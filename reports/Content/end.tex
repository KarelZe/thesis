\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The goal of this study is to examine the performance of machine learning-based trade classification in the option market. In particular, we propose to model trade classification with Transformers and gradient boosting. Both approaches are supervised and leverage labelled trades. For settings, where labelled trades are scarce, we extend Transformers with a pre-training objective to train on unlabelled trades as well as generate pseudo-labels for gradient boosting through a self-training procedure.

Relative to the ubiquitous tick test, quote rule, and LR algorithm, improvements are \SI{23.88}{\percent}, \SI{17.11}{\percent}, and \SI{17.02}{\percent}, respectively on the \gls{ISE} dataset without additional data requirements. Outperformance is particularly strong for \gls{OTM} options, options with a long maturity, as well as trades executed at the quotes.

Considering, the semi-supervised setting, Transformers on \gls{ISE} dataset profit from pre-training on unlabelled trades with accuracies up to \SI{74.55}{\percent}, but the performance gains slightly diminish on the \gls{CBOE} test set. Vice versa, we observe no advantage regarding performance or robustness from semi-supervised training of \glspl{GBRT}.

Consistent with \textcites[][27]{grauerOptionTradeClassification2022}[][901]{savickasInferringDirectionOption2003} we find evidence that the performance of common trade classification rules deteriorates in the option market. In particular, tick-base methods marginally outperform a random guess.

Unlike previous studies, we can trace back the performance of our approaches as well as of trade classification rules to individual features and feature groups using the importance measure \gls{SAGE}. We find that both paradigms attain the largest performance improvements from classifying trades based on quoted sizes and prices, but machine learning-based classifiers attain higher performance gains and effectively exploit the data. The change in the trade price, decisive criteria to the (reverse) tick test, plays no role in option trade classification. We identify the relative illiquidity of options to affect the information content of the surrounding trade prices. Our classifiers profit from the inclusion of option-specific features, like moneyness and time-to-maturity, unexploited in classical trade classification.

By probing and visualising the attention mechanism inside the Transformer, we can establish a connection to rule-based classification. Graphically, our results show, that attention heads encode knowledge about rule-based classification. Whilst attention heads in earlier layers of the network broadly attend to all features or their embeddings, later they focus on specific features jointly used in rule-based classification akin to the \gls{LR} algorithm, depth rule or others. Furthermore, embeddings encode domain knowledge. Our results demonstrate exemplary for traded underlying, that the Transformer learns to group similar underlyings in embedding space.

Our classifiers deliver accurate predictions and improved robustness, which effectively reduces noise and bias in option research dependent on reliable trade initiator estimates. When applied to measuring trading cost through effective spreads, the models dominate all rule-based approaches by approximating the true effective spread of options best. Exemplary, the Transformer pre-trained on unlabelled trades estimates a mean spread of  \SI[round-mode=places, round-precision=3]{0.013118}[\$]{} versus \SI[round-mode=places, round-precision=3]{0.004926}[\$]{} actual spread at the \gls{ISE}.

In conclusion, our study showcases the efficacy of machine learning as a viable alternative to existing trade signing algorithms for classifying option trades, if partially-labelled or labelled trades are available for training. % While we tested our models on option trades, we expect the results to transfer to other modalities including equity trades.

\section{Outlook}\label{sec:outlook}

In future work, we plan to revisit training Transformers on a larger corpus of unlabelled trades through pre-training objectives and study the effects from \emph{exchange-specific} finetuning. While our current results show that pre-training positively drives classification performance, for comparability it is only performed on a small subset of trades and models have not fully converged. Thus, we expect to see benefits from additional data and compute, following the scaling laws of \textcite[][7]{hoffmannTrainingComputeOptimalLarge2022}. The application confers advantages when finetuning is constrained due to the limited availability of the true trade initiator.

Indicatively, our results show that specific attention heads in the Transformer specialise in patterns akin to classical trade classification rules. We want to explore this aspect further and potentially reverse engineer classification rules from attention heads that are yet unknown. This way, we can transfer the superior classification accuracy of the Transformer to regimes where labels are unavailable or computational costs of training are not affordable.
