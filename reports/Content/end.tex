Relative to related works performing trade classification using machine learning, the improvements are strong, as a comparison against \cref{app:literature-ml-tc} reveals.

\section{Outlook}\label{sec:outlook}

Graphically, our results show that specific attention heads in the Transformer specialise in patterns akin to classical trade classification rules. We are excited to explore this aspect systematically and potentially reverse engineer classification rules from attention heads that are yet unknown. This way, we can transfer the superior classification accuracy of the Transformer to regimes where labelled training data is abundant or computational costs of training are not affordable.
