Recently, a method known as deep learning, which achieves high performance mainly in image recognition and speech recognition, has attracted attention in the machine learning field. This paper implements deep learning to predict one-month-ahead stock returns in the cross-section in the Japanese stock market and investigates the performance of the method. Our results show that deep neural networks generally outperform shallow neural networks, and the best networks also outperform representative machine learning models. These results indicate that deep learning shows promise as a skillful machine learning method to predict stock returns in the cross-section.},

The nature of stream data makes it essential to use algorithms which require only one pass over the data. Recently, single-scan, stream analysis methods have been proposed in this context. However, a lot of stream data is highdimensional in nature. High-dimensional data is inherently more complex in clustering, classification, and similarity search. Recent research discusses methods for projected clustering over high-dimensional data sets. This method is however difficult to generalize to data streams because of the complexity of the method and the large volume of the data streams.},

We compare a range of models in the machine learning repertoire in their ability to predict the sign and magnitude of abnormal stock returns around earnings announcements based on past financial statement data alone. Random Forests produce the most accurate forecasts and the highest abnormal returns. (Nonlinear) neural network-based models perform relatively better for predictions of extreme market reactions, while the linear methods are relatively better in predicting moderate market reactions. Long-short portfolios based on model predictions generate sizable abnormal returns, which seem to decay over time. Abnormal returns are robust to various risk factors and load in expected ways on size, value and accruals. Analysing the underlying economic drivers of the performance of the Random Forests, we find that the models select as most important predictors financial variables required to forecast free cash flows and firm characteristics that are known cross-sectional predictors of stock returns.},

  abstract = {While the authors of Batch Normalization (BN) identify and address an important problem involved in training deep networks-- \textbackslash textit\{Internal Covariate Shift\}-- the current solution has certain drawbacks. For instance, BN depends on batch statistics for layerwise input normalization during training which makes the estimates of mean and standard deviation of input (distribution) to hidden layers inaccurate due to shifting parameter values (especially during initial training epochs). Another fundamental problem with BN is that it cannot be used with batch-size \$ 1 \$ during training. We address these drawbacks of BN by proposing a non-adaptive normalization technique for removing covariate shift, that we call \textbackslash textit\{Normalization Propagation\}. Our approach does not depend on batch statistics, but rather uses a data-independent parametric estimate of mean and standard-deviation in every layer thus being computationally faster compared with BN. We exploit the observation that the pre-activation before Rectified Linear Units follow Gaussian distribution in deep networks, and that once the first and second order statistics of any given dataset are normalized, we can forward propagate this normalization without the need for recalculating the approximate statistics for hidden layers.},

However, such methods are domain-specific and little has been done to leverage this technique on real-world tabular datasets. We propose SCARF, a simple, widely-applicable technique for contrastive learning, where views are formed by corrupting a random subset of features. When applied to pre-train deep neural networks on the 69 real-world, tabular classification datasets from the OpenML-CC18 benchmark, SCARF not only improves classification accuracy in the fully-supervised setting but does so also in the presence of label noise and in the semi-supervised setting where only a fraction of the available training data is labeled. We show that SCARF complements existing strategies and outperforms alternatives like autoencoders. We conduct comprehensive ablations, detailing the importance of a range of factors.},

  abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

Intrinsic volatility in the stock market across the globe makes the task of prediction challenging. Consequently, forecasting and diffusion modeling undermines a diverse range of problems encountered in predicting trends in the stock market. Minimizing forecasting error would minimize investment risk. In the current work, we pose the problem as a direction-predicting exercise signifying gains and losses. We develop an experimental framework for the classification problem which predicts whether stock prices will increase or decrease with respect to the price prevailing n days earlier. Two algorithms, random forests, and gradient boosted decisio`n trees (using XGBoost) facilitate this connection by using ensembles of decision trees. We test our approach and report the accuracies for a variety of companies as improvement over existing predictions.

Ideally, one would like to think that cross-validation estimates the prediction error for the model at hand, fit to the training data. We prove that this is not the case for the linear model fit by ordinary least squares; rather it estimates the average prediction error of models fit on other unseen training sets drawn from the same population. We further show that this phenomenon occurs for most popular estimates of prediction error, including data splitting, bootstrapping, and Mallow's Cp. Next, the standard confidence intervals for prediction error derived from cross-validation may have coverage far below the desired level. Because each data point is used for both training and testing, there are correlations among the measured accuracies for each fold, and so the usual estimate of variance is too small. We introduce a nested cross-validation scheme to estimate this variance more accurately, and we show empirically that this modification leads to intervals with approximately correct coverage in many examples where traditional cross-validation intervals fail.},

The regularity is evidenced by a predictable relationship between the trade sign (trade initiator), size of the trade, and the contents of the limit order book before the trade. We demonstrate this predictability by developing an empirical inference model to classify trades into buyer-initiated and sellerinitiated. The model employs a local non-parametric method, k-nearest neighbor, which in the past was used successfully for chaotic time series prediction. The k-nearest neighbor with three predictor variables achieves an average out-of-sample classification accuracy of 71.40\%, compared to 63.32\% for the linear logistic regression with seven predictor variables. The result suggests that a non-linear approach may produce a more parsimonious trade sign inference model with a higher out-of-sample classification accuracy. Furthermore, for most of our stocks the observed regularity in market order submissions seems to have a memory of at least 30 trading days.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class.

Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using realworld datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

Notably, this efficiency comes at a significant loss of accuracy. Specifically, misclassification increases by 7.4 to 16.3 percentage points (or 46\% to 291\%) when switching from TR to BVC. Additionally, TR produces more accurate estimates of order imbalances and of order flow toxicity (VPIN).},

  abstract = {Transformer models can use two fundamentally different kinds of information: information stored in weights during training, and information provided ``in-context'' at inference time. In this work, we show that transformers exhibit different inductive biases in how they represent and generalize from the information in these two sources. In particular, we characterize whether they generalize via parsimonious rules (rule-based generalization) or via direct comparison with observed examples (exemplar-based generalization). This is of important practical consequence, as it informs whether to encode information in weights or in context, depending on how we want models to use that information. In transformers trained on controlled stimuli, we find that generalization from weights is more rule-based whereas generalization from context is largely exemplar-based. In contrast, we find that in transformers pre-trained on natural language, in-context learning is significantly rule-based, with larger models showing more rule-basedness. We hypothesise that rule-based generalization from in-context information might be an emergent consequence of large-scale training on language, which has sparse rule-like structure. Using controlled stimuli, we verify that transformers pretrained on data containing sparse rule-like structure exhibit more rule-based generalization.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

In this paper, we describe a scalable endto-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

In this work, we explore goals defined in terms of (non-expert) human preferences between pairs of trajectory segments. We show that this approach can effectively solve complex RL tasks without access to the reward function, including Atari games and simulated robot locomotion, while providing feedback on less than one percent of our agent's interactions with the environment. This reduces the cost of human oversight far enough that it can be practically applied to state-of-the-art RL systems. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we show that we can successfully train complex novel behaviors with about an hour of human time. These behaviors and environments are considerably more complex than any that have been previously learned from human feedback.},

We confirm that it is impossible to obtain a consistent classifier without deep trees as the base learners of AdaBoost in some complicated situations.

We then perform a comparative analysis of these methods using data on U.S. equities.

Gradient boosted regression trees are employed to learn the pricing map for a couple of classical, time-consuming problems in quantitative finance. In particular, we illustrate this methodology by reducing computation times for pricing exotic derivative products and American options. Once the gradient boosting model is trained, it is used to make fast predictions of new prices. We show that this approach leads to speed-ups of several orders of magnitude, while the loss of accuracy is very acceptable from a practical point of view. Besides the predictive performance of machine learning methods, financial regulators attach more and more importance to the interpretability of pricing models. For both applications, we therefore look under the hood of the gradient boosting model and try to reveal how the price is constructed and interpreted.},

For the same reason the recommendation systems are designed to help finding information in large websites. They are basically developed to offer products to the customers in an automated fashion to help them to do conveniently their shopping. The developing of such systems is important since there are often a large number of factors involved in purchasing a product that would make it difficult for the customer to make the best decision. Finding relationship among users and relationships among products are important issue in these systems. One of relations is similarity. Measure similarity among users and products is used in the pure methods for calculating similarity degree. In this paper, semantic similarity is used to find a set of k nearest neighbours to the target user, or target item. Thus, because of incorporating semantic similarity in the proposed recommendation system, from the experimental results, the high accuracy was obtained on private building company dataset in comparison with state-of-the-art recommender systems.},

Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems\textemdash from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero               1               for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4\,\texttimes\,4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor's algorithm improves on Strassen's two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago               2               . We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor's ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.},

  abstract = {This time series is an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions data provided by The National Bureau of Economic Research (http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html) (NBER). Our time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters of turning points without designating a date within the period that turning points occurred. The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a specific date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment on this issue by the NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of the period following a peak and ends on the last day of the period of the trough. For more options on recession shading, see the notes and links below. The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession period. The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its own publications. One version of this time series is represented using the midpoint method (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USRECM) The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. The trough method is used for this series. The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. Here is an example of this time series represented using the peak method (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USRECP).},

State-of-the-art algorithms including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), TensorFlow and dropout design provide imple- mentation and efficient factor exploration. To illustrate our methodology, we revisit the equity market risk premium dataset of Welch and Goyal (2008). We find the existence of nonlinear factors which explain predictability of returns, in particular at the extremes of the characteristic space. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.},

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.

However, the proposed models are usually not properly compared to each other and existing works often use different benchmarks and experiment protocols. As a result, it is unclear for both researchers and practitioners what models perform best. Additionally, the field still lacks effective baselines, that is, the easy-to-use models that provide competitive performance across different problems.In this work, we perform an overview of the main families of DL architectures for tabular data and raise the bar of baselines in tabular DL by identifying two simple and powerful deep architectures. The first one is a ResNet-like architecture which turns out to be a strong baseline that is often missing in prior works. The second model is our simple adaptation of the Transformer architecture for tabular data, which outperforms other solutions on most tasks. Both models are compared to many existing architectures on a diverse set of tasks under the same training and tuning protocols. We also compare the best DL models with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and conclude that there is still no universally superior solution.

In particular, the prevailing Lee and Ready algorithm is only able to correctly sign between 60\% to 64\% of option trades, which is a similar magnitude as using the quote rule alone. We find that the overall weak performance is due to sophisticated customers who often use limit orders instead of market orders to implement their trading strategies.

Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data ({$\sim$}10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and neural networks.

All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.

Feature selection which selects a subset from observed features is a widely used approach for improving performance and effectiveness of machine learning models with high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel AutoEncoder Feature Selector (AEFS) for unsupervised feature selection which combines autoencoder regression and group lasso tasks. Compared to traditional feature selection methods, AEFS can select the most important features by excavating both linear and nonlinear information among features, which is more flexible than the conventional self-representation method for unsupervised feature selection with only linear assumptions. Experimental results on benchmark dataset show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract = {Recent large-scale text-driven synthesis models have attracted much attention thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images that follow given text prompts. Such text-based synthesis methods are particularly appealing to humans who are used to verbally describe their intent. Therefore, it is only natural to extend the text-driven image synthesis to text-driven image editing. Editing is challenging for these generative models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve most of the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome. State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text only. To this end, we analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this observation, we present several applications which monitor the image synthesis by editing the textual prompt only. This includes localized editing by replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even delicately controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present our results over diverse images and prompts, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts.},

Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate.

With this taxonomy, we provide an outlook on potential future directions for both researchers and practitioners. We finally apply ML to typical problems in finance.

Existing autoregressive models either suffer from excessively large computational resource requirements for high dimensional data, or make compromises in terms of distribution expressiveness or ease of implementation in order to decrease resource requirements. Our architecture, by contrast, maintains both full expressiveness over joint distributions over data and ease of implementation with standard deep learning frameworks, while requiring reasonable memory and computation and achieving state-of-the-art results on standard generative modeling benchmarks. Our models are based on axial attention, a simple generalization of self-attention that naturally aligns with the multiple dimensions of the tensors in both the encoding and the decoding settings. Notably the proposed structure of the layers allows for the vast majority of the context to be computed in parallel during decoding without introducing any independence assumptions. This semi-parallel structure goes a long way to making decoding from even a very large Axial Transformer broadly applicable. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the Axial Transformer on the ImageNet-32 and ImageNet-64 image benchmarks as well as on the BAIR Robotic Pushing video benchmark.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background: Deep learning models are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent or one of its variants. These methods update the weights using their gradient, estimated from a small fraction of the training data. It has been observed that when using large batch sizes there is a persistent degradation in generalization performance -  known as the "generalization gap" phenomenon. Identifying the origin of this gap and closing it had remained an open problem.  Contributions: We examine the initial high learning rate training phase. We find that the weight distance from its initialization grows logarithmically with the number of weight updates. We therefore propose a "random walk on a random landscape" statistical model which is known to exhibit similar "ultra-slow" diffusion behavior. Following this hypothesis we conducted experiments to show empirically that the "generalization gap" stems from the relatively small number of updates rather than the batch size, and can be completely eliminated by adapting the training regime used. We further investigate different techniques to train models in the large-batch regime and present a novel algorithm named "Ghost Batch Normalization" which enables significant decrease in the generalization gap without increasing the number of updates. To validate our findings we conduct several additional experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally, we reassess common practices and beliefs concerning training of deep models and suggest they may not be optimal to achieve good generalization.},

However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters. To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique, which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling, is simple, yet surprisingly effective. We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain error rates of 3.4\% and 17.4\% respectively.},

  abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

We also show that this Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) procedure finds much flatter solutions than SGD, and approximates the recent Fast Geometric Ensembling (FGE) approach with a single model. Using SWA we achieve notable improvement in test accuracy over conventional SGD training on a range of state-of-the-art residual networks, PyramidNets, DenseNets, and Shake-Shake networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In short, SWA is extremely easy to implement, improves generalization, and has almost no computational overhead.},

In this study, a data mining (DM) approach to predict the performance of P2P loan before funded is proposed. Using data from the Lending Club, we explore the characteristics of loan and its applicant and use random forest to do the feature selection in the modeling phase. The Difference from other risk prediction models is that the prediction is classified into three or four categories, rather than just two the default and not default classes. Then we compare five DM models: two decision trees (DTs), two neural networks (NNs) and one support vector machine (SVM) and use two metrics: average percent hit rate and area of the lift cumulative curve to evaluate the prediction results. The Empirical result shows that the term of loan, annual income, the amount of loan, debt-to-income ratio, credit grade and revolving line utilization play an important role in loan defaults. And SVM, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Multi-layer perceptron (MPL)'s prediction performance are almost equal.},

An abundant literature addresses missing values in an inferential framework: estimating parameters and their variance from incomplete tables. Here, we consider supervised-learning settings: predicting a target when missing values appear in both training and testing data. We show the consistency of two approaches in prediction. A striking result is that the widely-used method of imputing with a constant, such as the mean prior to learning is consistent when missing values are not informative. This contrasts with inferential settings where mean imputation is pointed at for distorting the distribution of the data. That such a simple approach can be consistent is important in practice. We also show that a predictor suited for complete observations can predict optimally on incomplete data,through multiple imputation.Finally, to compare imputation with learning directly with a model that accounts for missing values, we analyze further decision trees. These can naturally tackle empirical risk minimization with missing values, due to their ability to handle the half-discrete nature of incomplete variables. After comparing theoretically and empirically different missing values strategies in trees, we recommend using the "missing incorporated in attribute" method as it can handle both non-informative and informative missing values.},

As a result, we propose regularizing plain Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks by searching for the optimal combination/cocktail of 13 regularization techniques for each dataset using a joint optimization over the decision on which regularizers to apply and their subsidiary hyperparameters. We empirically assess the impact of these regularization cocktails for MLPs in a large-scale empirical study comprising 40 tabular datasets and demonstrate that (i) well-regularized plain MLPs significantly outperform recent state-of-the-art specialized neural network architectures, and (ii) they even outperform strong traditional ML methods, such as XGBoost.},

In this paper, we present several variants of combining single and multiple imputation with bootstrapping to create ensembles that can model uncertainty and diversity in the data, and that are robust to high missingness in the data. We present three ensemble strategies: bootstrapping on incomplete data followed by (i) single imputation and (ii) multiple imputation, and (iii) multiple imputation ensemble without bootstrapping. We perform an extensive evaluation of the performance of the these ensemble strategies on 8 datasets by varying the missingness ratio. Our results show that bootstrapping followed by multiple imputation using expectation maximization is the most robust method even at high missingness ratio (up to 30\%). For small missingness ratio (up to 10\%) most of the ensemble methods perform quivalently but better than single imputation. Kappa-error plots suggest that accurate classifiers with reasonable diversity is the reason for this behaviour. A consistent observation in all the datasets suggests that for small missingness (up to 10\%), bootstrapping on incomplete data without any imputation produces equivalent results to other ensemble methods.},

There is an intense pressure on industrial plants to continue reducing unscheduled downtime, performance degradation, and safety hazards, which requires detecting and recovering potential faults in its early stages. Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool due to its ability to rapidly and efficiently processing collected signals and providing accurate diagnosis results. Although many studies have developed machine leaning (M.L) and deep learning (D.L) algorithms for detecting the bearing fault, the results have generally been limited to relatively small train and test datasets and the input data has been manipulated (selective features used) to reach high accuracy. In this work, the raw data, collected from accelerometers (time-domain features) are taken as the input of a novel temporal sequence prediction algorithm to present an end-to-end method for fault detection. We use equivalent temporal sequences as the input of a novel Convolutional Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) to detect the bearing fault with the highest accuracy in the shortest possible time. The method can reach the highest accuracy in the literature, to the best knowledge of the authors of the present paper, voiding any sort of pre-processing or manipulation of the input data. Effectiveness and feasibility of the fault diagnosis method are validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration datasets and comparing the result with the other intelligent fault diagnosis methods.},

Our approach uses self-attention to reason about relationships between datapoints explicitly, which can be seen as realizing non-parametric models using parametric attention mechanisms. However, unlike conventional non-parametric models, we let the model learn end-to-end from the data how to make use of other datapoints for prediction. Empirically, our models solve cross-datapoint lookup and complex reasoning tasks unsolvable by traditional deep learning models. We show highly competitive results on tabular data, early results on CIFAR-10, and give insight into how the model makes use of the interactions between points.},

This article implements and analyses the effectiveness of deep neural networks (DNN), gradient-boosted-trees (GBT), random forests (RAF), and several ensembles of these methods in the context of statistical arbitrage. Each model is trained on lagged returns of all stocks in the S\&P 500, after elimination of survivor bias. From 1992 to 2015, daily one-day-ahead trading signals are generated based on the probability forecast of a stock to outperform the general market. The highest k probabilities are converted into long and the lowest k probabilities into short positions, thus censoring the less certain middle part of the ranking. Empirical findings are promising. A simple, equal-weighted ensemble (ENS1) consisting of one deep neural network, one gradient-boosted tree, and one random forest produces out-of-sample returns exceeding 0.45 percent per day for k = 10, prior to transaction costs. Irrespective of the fact that profits are declining in recent years, our findings pose a severe challenge to the semi-strong form of market efficiency.},

This study provides an answer to how learning performance differs between humans and machines when there is limited training data. We have designed an experiment in which 44 humans and three different machine learning algorithms identify patterns in labeled training data and have to label instances according to the patterns they find. The results show a high dependency between performance and the underlying patterns of the task. Whereas humans perform relatively similarly across all patterns, machines show large performance differences for the various patterns in our experiment. After seeing 20 instances in the experiment, human performance does not improve anymore, which we relate to theories of cognitive overload. Machines learn slower but can reach the same level or may even outperform humans in 2 of the 4 of used patterns. However, machines need more instances compared to humans for the same results. The performance of machines is comparably lower for the other 2 patterns due to the difficulty of combining input features.},

Yet, this widespread practice has no theoretical grounding. Here we show that for almost all imputation functions, an impute-then-regress procedure with a powerful learner is Bayes optimal. This result holds for all missing-values mechanisms, in contrast with the classic statistical results that require missing-at-random settings to use imputation in probabilistic modeling. Moreover, it implies that perfect conditional imputation is not needed for good prediction asymptotically. In fact, we show that on perfectly imputed data the best regression function will generally be discontinuous, which makes it hard to learn. Crafting instead the imputation so as to leave the regression function unchanged simply shifts the problem to learning discontinuous imputations. Rather, we suggest that it is easier to learn imputation and regression jointly. We propose such a procedure, adapting NeuMiss, a neural network capturing the conditional links across observed and unobserved variables whatever the missing-value pattern. Our experiments confirm that joint imputation and regression through NeuMiss is better than various two step procedures in a finite-sample regime.},

In this paper, we propose a cofactorization model, CoFactor, which jointly decomposes the user-item interaction matrix and the item-item co-occurrence matrix with shared item latent factors. For each pair of items, the co-occurrence matrix encodes the number of users that have consumed both items. CoFactor is inspired by the recent success of word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) which can be interpreted as factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix. We show that this model significantly improves the performance over MF models on several datasets with little additional computational overhead. We provide qualitative results that explain how CoFactor improves the quality of the inferred factors and characterize the circumstances where it provides the most significant improvements.},

The second principle is interpretability. Investors must understand a model's output well enough to trust it and extract some general insight from it. To this end, we choose a concise set of predictor variables, and we apply a novel method called the Model Fingerprint to reveal the linear, nonlinear, and interaction effects that drive a model's predictions. The third principle is that a model's predictions should be interesting, by which we mean they should convincingly outperform simpler models. To this end, we evaluate performance out-of-sample compared to linear regressions. In addition to these three principles, we also consider the important role people play by imparting domain knowledge and preferences to a model. We argue that adjusting the prediction goal is one of the most powerful ways to do this. We test random forest, boosted trees and neural network models for multiple calibrations which we conclude are investable, interpretable, and interesting.},

While several deep learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically comprise black-box models which do not account for the full range of inputs present in common scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use-cases of TFT.},

When we take anomalies out-of-sample by moving either backward or forward in time, their average returns decrease and volatilities increase. These patterns emerge because datasnooping works through t-values, and an anomaly's t-value is high if its average return is high or volatility low. The average anomaly's in-sample Sharpe ratio is biased upwards by a factor of three. The data-snooping problem is so severe that we would expect to reject even the true asset pricing model when tested using in-sample data. Our results suggest that asset pricing models should be tested using out-of-sample data or, if not not feasible, that the correct standard by which to judge a model is its ability to explain half of the in-sample alpha.},

A simple and e ective method, based on weighted voting, is introduced for constructing a compound algorithm in such a circumstance. We call this method the Weighted Majority Algorithm. We show that this algorithm is robust in the presence of errors in the data. We discuss various versions of the Weighted Majority Algorithm and prove mistake bounds for them that are closely related to the mistake bounds of the best algorithms of the pool. For example, given a sequence of trials, if there is an algorithm in the pool A that makes at most m mistakes then the Weighted Majority Algorithm will make at most c(log jAj + m) mistakes on that sequence, where c is xed constant.},

  abstract = {Data is a valuable resource. Proper use of high-quality data can help people make better predictions, analyses and decisions. However, no matter how much effort we put into collecting a good dataset, errors will inevitably creep into the data, making it necessary for data cleaning. This becomes a concern particularly when large-scale heterogeneous data from multiple sources are integrated for other purposes. Data cleaning can be complicated, timeconsuming, and expensive, but it is a necessary step in any data-related system since poor-quality data may not be suitable to achieve the intended purposes. The core of our data cleaning system is data association and repairing. Association aims to identify the same object and link with the most associated objects, and repairing is to make a database reliable by fixing errors in the data. For big data applications, we don't necessarily need to use all the data. In most situations, we only need a small subset of the most relevant data. So the goal of association is to convert big raw data into a small subset of the most relevant data that are most useful for a particular application. After we obtain a small amount of relevant data, we also need to further analyze the data to help people digest the data and turn the data into knowledge. We use a number of techniques to associate the data to get useful knowledge for data repairing. Our research shows that data association can effectively help with data repairing. To capture the interaction, we provide a uniform framework that unifies the association and repairing process seamlessly based on context patterns, usage patterns, metadata, and repairing rules.},

Despite the ubiquitous adoption of production-scale deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, these general-purpose frameworks fall short of business demands in recommendation scenarios for various reasons: on one hand, tweaking systems based on static parameters and dense computations for recommendation with dynamic and sparse features is detrimental to model quality; on the other hand, such frameworks are designed with batch-training stage and serving stage completely separated, preventing the model from interacting with customer feedback in real-time. These issues led us to reexamine traditional approaches and explore radically different design choices. In this paper, we present Monolith, a system tailored for online training. Our design has been driven by observations of our application workloads and production environment that reflects a marked departure from other recommendations systems. Our contributions are manifold: first, we crafted a collisionless embedding table with optimizations such as expirable embeddings and frequency filtering to reduce its memory footprint; second, we provide an production-ready online training architecture with high fault-tolerance; finally, we proved that system reliability could be traded-off for real-time learning. Monolith has successfully landed in the BytePlus Recommend product.},

Recent advances in recurrent neural networks have led to promising approaches to solving this problem, with long short-term memory model proving effective in capturing users' general interests from previous clicks. However, none of the existing approaches explicitly take the effects of users' current actions on their next moves into account. In this study, we argue that a long-term memory model may be insufficient for modeling long sessions that usually contain user interests drift caused by unintended clicks. A novel short-term attention/memory priority model is proposed as a remedy, which is capable of capturing users' general interests from the long-term memory of a session context, whilst taking into account users' current interests from the short-term memory of the last-clicks. The validity and efficacy of the proposed attention mechanism is extensively evaluated on three benchmark data sets from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and CIKM Cup 2016. The numerical results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in all the tests.},

  abstract = {Recommender systems help users find relevant items of interest, for example on e-commerce or media streaming sites. Most academic research is concerned with approaches that personalize the recommendations according to long-term user profiles. In many real-world applications, however, such long-term profiles often do not exist and recommendations therefore have to be made solely based on the observed behavior of a user during an ongoing session. Given the high practical relevance of the problem, an increased interest in this problem can be observed in recent years, leading to a number of proposals for session-based recommendation algorithms that typically aim to predict the user's immediate next actions. In this work, we present the results of an in-depth performance comparison of a number of such algorithms, using a variety of datasets and evaluation measures. Our comparison includes the most recent approaches based on recurrent neural networks like GRU4REC, factorized Markov model approaches such as FISM or FOSSIL, as well as simpler methods based, e.g., on nearest neighbor schemes. Our experiments reveal that algorithms of this latter class, despite their sometimes almost trivial nature, often perform equally well or significantly better than today's more complex approaches based on deep neural networks. Our results therefore suggest that there is substantial room for improvement regarding the development of more sophisticated session-based recommendation algorithms.},

  abstract = {Interpreting predictions from tree ensemble methods such as gradient boosting machines and random forests is important, yet feature attribution for trees is often heuristic and not individualized for each prediction. Here we show that popular feature attribution methods are inconsistent, meaning they can lower a feature's assigned importance when the true impact of that feature actually increases. This is a fundamental problem that casts doubt on any comparison between features. To address it we turn to recent applications of game theory and develop fast exact tree solutions for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values, which are the unique consistent and locally accurate attribution values. We then extend SHAP values to interaction effects and define SHAP interaction values. We propose a rich visualization of individualized feature attributions that improves over classic attribution summaries and partial dependence plots, and a unique "supervised" clustering (clustering based on feature attributions). We demonstrate better agreement with human intuition through a user study, exponential improvements in run time, improved clustering performance, and better identification of influential features. An implementation of our algorithm has also been merged into XGBoost and LightGBM, see http://github.com/slundberg/shap for details.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

  abstract = {Session-based recommendation becomes a research hotspot for its ability to make recommendations for anonymous users. However, existing session-based methods have the following limitations: (1) They either lack the capability to learn complex dependencies or focus mostly on the current session without explicitly considering collaborative information. (2) They assume that the representation of an item is static and fixed for all users at each time step. We argue that even the same item can be represented differently for different users at the same time step. To this end, we propose a novel solution, Collaborative Self-Attention Network (CoSAN) for session-based recommendation, to learn the session representation and predict the intent of the current session by investigating neighborhood sessions. Specially, we first devise a collaborative item representation by aggregating the embedding of neighborhood sessions retrieved according to each item in the current session. Then, we apply self-attention to learn long-range dependencies between collaborative items and generate collaborative session representation. Finally, each session is represented by concatenating the collaborative session representation and the embedding of the current session. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that CoSAN constantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

We reassess the conventional wisdom on market efficiency in light of this fact. In our model economy, which resembles a typical machine learning setting, N assets have cash flows that are a linear function of J firm characteristics, but with uncertain coefficients. Risk-neutral Bayesian investors impose shrinkage (ridge regression) or sparsity (Lasso) when they estimate the J coefficients of the model and use them to price assets. When J is comparable in size to N, returns appear cross-sectionally predictable using firm characteristics to an econometrician who analyzes data from the economy ex post. A factor zoo emerges even without p-hacking and data-mining. Standard in-sample tests of market efficiency reject the no-predictability null with high probability, despite the fact that investors optimally use the information available to them in real time. In contrast, out-of-sample tests retain their economic meaning.},

  abstract = {Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related, and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the Predictive, Descriptive, Relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides three overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post-hoc categories, with sub-groups including sparsity, modularity and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often under-appreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.},

While the predetermined features of interest (FoI) enable modest ML methods like linear regression and elastic net to outperform their corresponding baseline, more complex models such as random forest and neural networks are superior regarding sharpe ratio and absolute mean return.

SSL algorithms based on deep neural networks have recently proven successful on standard benchmark tasks. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to address many issues that these algorithms would face in real-world applications. After creating a unified reimplementation of various widely-used SSL techniques, we test them in a suite of experiments designed to address these issues. We find that the performance of simple baselines which do not use unlabeled data is often underreported, that SSL methods differ in sensitivity to the amount of labeled and unlabeled data, and that performance can degrade substantially when the unlabeled dataset contains out-of-class examples. To help guide SSL research towards real-world applicability, we make our unified reimplemention and evaluation platform publicly available.},

  abstract = {Industry takes a great interest in verification techniques to improve the reliability of process designs. Providing reliable design in application domains like spectrum auctions is crucial. Spectrum auction revenue is considered as one of the principal sources for governmental income. Hence, analyzing the auction design before applying it can ensure absence of undesirable results of an auction. Those results might even be bad, if they occur with a probability of just higher than zero. Current verification approaches are mainly devoted to verify control flows only, although data values play a significant role in real life applications. Thus, these approaches are not sufficient to support data-centered workflows as spectrum auctions. We address this issue by providing a new data-centered verification approach to analyze Simultaneous Multi-Round (SMR) auction design in BPMN format. We show how to enhance a BPMN model by including important information, namely data values used in the workflow, which the standard BPMN 2.0 does not support. An example of a data value in a SMR auction is the ''auctioneer's revenue''. To enable the verification of data-centered properties, we have developed a transformation of a data-value enhanced BPMN model to Petri Nets respecting the semantics of certain data value usages. For that, we support dynamic and correlated data values. By employing a model checker and defining data-centered properties in CTL formula, we verify SMR auction models to find undesirable executions for auctioneers. For example, we can precisely detect the worst values of three important measures in auctions: efficiency, revenue, and bidder's profit. With it, we can not only find the undesirable outcomes, but also provide a counter-example to help an auctioneer to improve the auction design.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the issue of mining association rules among items in a large database of sales transactions. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear in a su cient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets rst and then, identifying, within this candidate set, those itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally this is done iteratively for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k where a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate large itemsets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we propose an e ective hash-based algorithm for the candidate set generation. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to e ectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations signi cantly. Extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm.},

These large databases are well suited to train machine learning models, e.g., for forecasting or to extract biomarkers in biomedical settings. Such predictive approaches can use discriminative\textemdash rather than generative\textemdash modeling and thus open the door to new missing-values strategies. Yet existing empirical evaluations of strategies to handle missing values have focused on inferential statistics.                                         Results               Here we conduct a systematic benchmark of missing-values strategies in predictive models with a focus on large health databases: 4 electronic health record datasets, 1 population brain imaging database, 1 health survey, and 2 intensive care surveys. Using gradient-boosted trees, we compare native support for missing values with simple and state-of-the-art imputation prior to learning. We investigate prediction accuracy and computational time. For prediction after imputation, we find that adding an indicator to express which values have been imputed is important, suggesting that the data are missing not at random. Elaborate missing-values imputation can improve prediction compared to simple strategies but requires longer computational time on large data. Learning trees that model missing values\textemdash with missing incorporated attribute\textemdash leads to robust, fast, and well-performing predictive modeling.                                         Conclusions               Native support for missing values in supervised machine learning predicts better than state-of-the-art imputation with much less computational cost. When using imputation, it is important to add indicator columns expressing which values have been imputed.},

  pages = {17},
  abstract = {Tree induction is one of the most effective and widely used methods for building classification models. However, many applications require cases to be ranked by the probability of class membership. Probability estimation trees (PETs) have the same attractive features as classification trees (e.g., comprehensibility, accuracy and efficiency in high dimensions and on large data sets). Unfortunately, decision trees have been found to provide poor probability estimates. Several techniques have been proposed to build more accurate PETs, but, to our knowledge, there has not been a systematic experimental analysis of which techniques actually improve the probability-based rankings, and by how much. In this paper we first discuss why the decision-tree representation is not intrinsically inadequate for probability estimation. Inaccurate probabilities are partially the result of decision-tree induction algorithms that focus on maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing tree size (for example via reduced-error pruning). Larger trees can be better for probability estimation, even if the extra size is superfluous for accuracy maximization. We then present the results of a comprehensive set of experiments, testing some straightforward methods for improving probability-based rankings. We show that using a simple, common smoothing method\textemdash the Laplace correction\textemdash uniformly improves probability-based rankings. In addition, bagging substantially improves the rankings, and is even more effective for this purpose than for improving accuracy. We conclude that PETs, with these simple modifications, should be considered when rankings based on class-membership probability are required.},

BRT is a statistical method that generates forecasts on the basis of large sets of conditioning information without imposing strong parametric assumptions such as linearity or monotonicity. It applies soft weighting functions to the predictor variables and performs a type of model averaging that increases the stability of the forecasts and therefore protects it against overfitting. Our results indicate that expanding the conditioning information set results in greater out-of-sample predictive accuracy compared to the standard models proposed in the literature and that the forecasts generate profitable portfolio allocations even when market frictions are considered. By working directly with the mean-variance investor's conditional Euler equation we also characterize semi-parametrically the relation between the various covariates constituting the conditioning information set and the investor's optimal portfolio weights. Our results suggest that the relation between predictor variables and the optimal portfolio allocation to risky assets is highly non-linear.},

These rates are based on separate classifiable samples because each of the four rules fails to classify some trades (e.g., the quote rule cannot classify midspread trades). Outside-quote and reversed-quote trades are highly misclassified by all four rules. The probability of such trades is related to trading frequency, trade size, moneyness, and maturity. Underlying asset price changes around the time of the trade improve classification precision. We find that the components of index option complex trades not executed on the Retail Automated Execution System are misclassified almost 50\% of the time by any method. The elimination of these trades (15\% of the sample) results in a success rate of over 87\% for the quote rule.},

In this paper we present an explanation of how recommender systems help Ecommerce sites increase sales, and analyze six sites that use recommender systems including several sites that use more than one recommender system. Based on the examples, we create a taxonomy of recommender systems, including the interfaces they present to customers, the technologies used to create the recommendations, and the inputs they need from customers.

These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years.

  abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.},

We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use of the more relevant inputs. However, this will lead to an intractable number of hyperparameters. Here, we introduce Regularization Learning Networks (RLNs), which overcome this challenge by introducing an efficient hyperparameter tuning scheme which minimizes a new Counterfactual Loss. Our results show that RLNs significantly improve DNNs on tabular datasets, and achieve comparable results to GBTs, with the best performance achieved with an ensemble that combines GBTs and RLNs. RLNs produce extremely sparse networks, eliminating up to 99.8\% of the network edges and 82\% of the input features, thus providing more interpretable models and reveal the importance that the network assigns to different inputs. RLNs could efficiently learn a single network in datasets that comprise both tabular and unstructured data, such as in the setting of medical imaging accompanied by electronic health records. An open source implementation of RLN can be found at https://github.com/irashavitt/regularization\_ learning\_networks.},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate "reasonable bounds" -- linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ``black art'' requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract = {Gradient Boost is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms in use. And get this, it's not that complicated! This video is the second part in a series that walks through it one step at a time. This video focuses on the original Gradient Boost algorithm used to predict a continuous value, like someone's weight. We call this, "using Gradient Boost for Regression". In part 3, we'll walk though how Gradient Boost classifies samples into two different categories, and in part 4, we'll go through the math again, this time focusing on classification. NOTE: I need to clarify what I said at 21:08. With regression trees, the sample will only go to a single leaf, and this summation simply isolates the one output value of interest from all of the others. However, when I first made this video I was thinking that because Gradient Boost is supposed to work with any "weak learner", not just small regression trees, that this summation was a way to add flexibility to the algorithm. ALSO NOTE: There is a minor error at 15:47. It should be R\_jm, not R\_ij. Also, there are minor errors at 16:18 and 24:15. At 16:18, the leaf in the script is R\_1,2 and it should be R\_2,1. At 24:15, the header for the residual column should be r\_i,2.

  title = {Understanding and Improving Robustness and Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning},
  author = {Stutz, David},

  doi = {10.22028/D291-37286},
  abstract = {Deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant for many high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving or medical diagnosis where wrong decisions can have massive impact on human lives. Unfortunately, deep neural networks are typically assessed solely based on generalization, e.g., accuracy on a fixed test set. However, this is clearly insufficient for safe deployment as potential malicious actors and distribution shifts or the effects of quantization and unreliable hardware are disregarded. Thus, recent work additionally evaluates performance on potentially manipulated or corrupted inputs as well as after quantization and deployment on specialized hardware. In such settings, it is also important to obtain reasonable estimates of the model's confidence alongside its predictions. This thesis studies robustness and uncertainty estimation in deep learning along three main directions: First, we consider so-called adversarial examples, slightly perturbed inputs causing severe drops in accuracy. Second, we study weight perturbations, focusing particularly on bit errors in quantized weights. This is relevant for deploying models on special-purpose hardware for efficient inference, so-called accelerators. Finally, we address uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and provide meaningful statistical performance guarantees for safe deployment.  In detail, we study the existence of adversarial examples with respect to the underlying data manifold. In this context, we also investigate adversarial training which improves robustness by augmenting training with adversarial examples at the cost of reduced accuracy. We show that regular adversarial examples leave the data manifold in an almost orthogonal direction. While we find no inherent trade-off between robustness and accuracy, this contributes to a higher sample complexity as well as severe overfitting of adversarial training. Using a novel measure of flatness in the robust loss landscape with respect to weight changes, we also show that robust overfitting is caused by converging to particularly sharp minima. In fact, we find a clear correlation between flatness and good robust generalization.  Further, we study random and adversarial bit errors in quantized weights. In accelerators, random bit errors occur in the memory when reducing voltage with the goal of improving energy-efficiency. Here, we consider a robust quantization scheme, use weight clipping as regularization and perform random bit error training to improve bit error robustness, allowing considerable energy savings without requiring hardware changes. In contrast, adversarial bit errors are maliciously introduced through hardware- or software-based attacks on the memory, with severe consequences on performance. We propose a novel adversarial bit error attack to study this threat and use adversarial bit error training to improve robustness and thereby also the accelerator's security.  Finally, we view robustness in the context of uncertainty estimation. By encouraging low-confidence predictions on adversarial examples, our confidence-calibrated adversarial training successfully rejects adversarial, corrupted as well as out-of-distribution examples at test time. Thereby, we are also able to improve the robustness-accuracy trade-off compared to regular adversarial training. However, even robust models do not provide any guarantee for safe deployment. To address this problem, conformal prediction allows the model to predict confidence sets with user-specified guarantee of including the true label. Unfortunately, as conformal prediction is usually applied after training, the model is trained without taking this calibration step into account. To address this limitation, we propose conformal training which allows training conformal predictors end-to-end with the underlying model. This not only improves the obtained uncertainty estimates but also enables optimizing application-specific objectives without losing the provided guarantee.  Besides our work on robustness or uncertainty, we also address the problem of 3D shape completion of partially observed point clouds. Specifically, we consider an autonomous driving or robotics setting where vehicles are commonly equipped with LiDAR or depth sensors and obtaining a complete 3D representation of the environment is crucial. However, ground truth shapes that are essential for applying deep learning techniques are extremely difficult to obtain. Thus, we propose a weakly-supervised approach that can be trained on the incomplete point clouds while offering efficient inference.  In summary, this thesis contributes to our understanding of robustness against both input and weight perturbations. To this end, we also develop methods to improve robustness alongside uncertainty estimation for safe deployment of deep learning methods in high-stakes applications. In the particular context of autonomous driving, we also address 3D shape completion of sparse point clouds.},

Firstly, by using AdaBoost algorithm the database is trained to get the training samples. Secondly, the LSTM is utilized to forecast each training sample separately. Thirdly, AdaBoost algorithm is used to integrate the forecasting results of all the LSTM predictors to generate the ensemble results. Two major daily exchange rate datasets and two stock market index datasets are selected for model evaluation and comparison. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble learning approach outperforms some other single forecasting models and ensemble learning approaches. This suggests that the AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble learning approach is a highly promising approach for financial time series data forecasting, especially for the time series data with nonlinearity and irregularity, such as exchange rates and stock indexes.},

Advancement in computer technology has allowed many recent studies to utilize machine learning techniques such as neural networks and decision trees to predict stock returns. In the area of machine learning, classifier ensembles (i.e. combining multiple classifiers) have proven to be a method superior to single classifiers. In order to build a better model for predicting stock returns effectively and efficiently, this study aims at investigating the prediction performance that utilizes the classifier ensembles method to analyze stock returns. In particular, the hybrid methods of majority voting and bagging are considered. Moreover, performance using two types of classifier ensembles is compared with those using single baseline classifiers (i.e. neural networks, decision trees, and logistic regression). These two types of ensembles are `homogeneous' classifier ensembles (e.g. an ensemble of neural networks) and `heterogeneous' classifier ensembles (e.g. an ensemble of neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression). Average prediction accuracy, Type I and II errors, and return on investment of these models are also examined. Our results indicate that multiple classifiers outperform single classifiers in terms of prediction accuracy and returns on investment. In addition, heterogeneous classifier ensembles offer slightly better performance than the homogeneous ones. However, there is no significant difference between majority voting and bagging in prediction accuracy, but the former has better stock returns prediction accuracy than the latter. Finally, the homogeneous multiple classifiers using neural networks by majority voting perform best when predicting stock returns.},

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning has been shown to be very effective in learning useful representations, and yet much of the success is achieved in data types such as images, audio, and text. The success is mainly enabled by taking advantage of spatial, temporal, or semantic structure in the data through augmentation. However, such structure may not exist in tabular datasets commonly used in fields such as healthcare, making it difficult to design an effective augmentation method, and hindering a similar progress in tabular data setting. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, Subsetting features of Tabular data (SubTab), that turns the task of learning from tabular data into a multi-view representation learning problem by dividing the input features to multiple subsets. We argue that reconstructing the data from the subset of its features rather than its corrupted version in an autoencoder setting can better capture its underlying latent representation. In this framework, the joint representation can be expressed as the aggregate of latent variables of the subsets at test time, which we refer to as collaborative inference. Our experiments show that the SubTab achieves the state of the art (SOTA) performance of 98.31\% on MNIST in tabular setting, on par with CNN-based SOTA models, and surpasses existing baselines on three other real-world datasets by a significant margin.},

We identify and analyze architectural and optimization bottlenecks in recent efficient neural networks and provide ways to mitigate these bottlenecks. To this end, we design an efficient backbone MobileOne, with variants achieving an inference time under 1 ms on an iPhone12 with 75.9\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

  abstract = {To recommend the next item to a user in a transactional context is practical yet challenging in applications such as marketing campaigns. Transactional context refers to the items that are observable in a transaction. Most existing transactionbased recommender systems (TBRSs) make recommendations by mainly considering recently occurring items instead of all the ones observed in the current context. Moreover, they often assume a rigid order between items within a transaction, which is not always practical. More importantly, a long transaction often contains many items irreverent to the next choice, which tends to overwhelm the influence of a few truely relevant ones. Therefore, we posit that a good TBRS should not only consider all the observed items in the current transaction but also weight them with different relevance to build an attentive context that outputs the proper next item with a high probability. To this end, we design an effective attentionbased transaction embedding model (ATEM) for context embedding to weight each observed item in a transaction without assuming order. The empirical study on real-world transaction datasets proves that ATEM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and novelty.},

In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs which usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth characterization of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviors (e.g., users' clicks on items) and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research. Finally, we discuss new research opportunities in this exciting and vibrant area.},

  abstract = {Adaptive gradient algorithms borrow the moving average idea of heavy ball acceleration to estimate accurate first- and second-order moments of gradient for accelerating convergence. However, Nesterov acceleration which converges faster than heavy ball acceleration in theory and also in many empirical cases is much less investigated under the adaptive gradient setting. In this work, we propose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum algorithm, Adan for short, to speed up the training of deep neural networks effectively. Adan first reformulates the vanilla Nesterov acceleration to develop a new Nesterov momentum estimation (NME) method, which avoids the extra computation and memory overhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point. Then Adan adopts NME to estimate the first- and second-order moments of the gradient in adaptive gradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides, we prove that Adan finds an \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-approximate first-order stationary point within \$O(\textbackslash epsilon\^\{-3.5\})\$ stochastic gradient complexity on the nonconvex stochastic problems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the best-known lower bound. Extensive experimental results show that Adan surpasses the corresponding SoTA optimizers on both vision transformers (ViTs) and CNNs, and sets new SoTAs for many popular networks, e.g., ResNet, ConvNext, ViT, Swin, MAE, LSTM, Transformer-XL, and BERT. More surprisingly, Adan can use half of the training cost (epochs) of SoTA optimizers to achieve higher or comparable performance on ViT and ResNet, e.t.c., and also shows great tolerance to a large range of minibatch size, e.g., from 1k to 32k. We hope Adan can contribute to the development of deep learning by reducing training cost and relieving engineering burden of trying different optimizers on various architectures.

And effective stock price forecasting can help investors obtain higher returns. Based on the data set provided by Jane Street, this paper makes use of XGBoost model and LightGBM model to realize the prediction of stock price. Since the given training set has a large amount of data and includes abnormal data such as missing value, we first carry out feature engineering processing on the original data and take the mean value of the missing value, so as to obtain the preprocessed data that can be used in modeling.             The experimental results show that the combined model of XGBoost and LightGBM has better prediction performance than the single model and neural network.},

  abstract = {Handling missing data is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning. Among many approaches, the simplest and most intuitive way is zero imputation, which treats the value of a missing entry simply as zero. However, many studies have experimentally confirmed that zero imputation results in suboptimal performances in training neural networks. Yet, none of the existing work has explained what brings such performance degradations. In this paper, we introduce the variable sparsity problem (VSP), which describes a phenomenon where the output of a predictive model largely varies with respect to the rate of missingness in the given input, and show that it adversarially affects the model performance. We first theoretically analyze this phenomenon and propose a simple yet effective technique to handle missingness, which we refer to as Sparsity Normalization (SN), that directly targets and resolves the VSP. We further experimentally validate SN on diverse benchmark datasets, to show that debiasing the effect of input-level sparsity improves the performance and stabilizes the training of neural networks.},

  abstract = {Self- and semi-supervised learning frameworks have made significant progress in training machine learning models with limited labeled data in image and language domains. These methods heavily rely on the unique structure in the domain datasets (such as spatial relationships in images or semantic relationships in language). They are not adaptable to general tabular data which does not have the same explicit structure as image and language data. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing novel self- and semi-supervised learning frameworks for tabular data, which we refer to collectively as VIME (Value Imputation and Mask Estimation). We create a novel pretext task of estimating mask vectors from corrupted tabular data in addition to the reconstruction pretext task for self-supervised learning. We also introduce a novel tabular data augmentation method for self- and semi-supervised learning frameworks. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed framework in multiple tabular datasets from various application domains, such as genomics and clinical data. VIME exceeds state-of-the-art performance in comparison to the existing baseline methods.},

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},
