\section{Background and Motivation}

Every option trade has a buyer and seller side. For a plethora of problems in option research, it’s also crucial to determine the party that initiated the transaction. Applications include the study of option demand \autocite[][]{garleanuDemandBasedOptionPricing2009}, of informational content in option trading \autocites[][]{huDoesOptionTrading2014}[][]{panInformationOptionVolume2006}[][]{caoInformationalContentOption2005}, of order flow \autocite[][]{muravyevOrderFlowExpected2016}, or of trading costs \autocite[][]{muravyevOptionsTradingCosts2020}. 

Despite the clear importance for empirical research, the true initiator of the trade is frequently absent in datasets and is inferred using trade classification rules \autocite[][]{easleyOptionVolumeStock1998}. In consequence, the correctness of empirical studies hinges on the algorithm's ability to accurately identify the trade initiator.

Popular heuristic to sign trades are the tick test \autocite[][]{hasbrouckTradesQuotesInventories1988}, quote rule \autocite[][]{harrisDayEndTransactionPrice1989}, and hybrids thereof such as the \gls{LR} algorithm \autocite[][]{leeInferringTradeDirection1991}. These rules have initially been proposed and tested in the stock market. For option markets, the works of \textcites[][]{savickasInferringDirectionOption2003}[][]{grauerOptionTradeClassification2022} raise concerns about the transferability of trade signing rules due to deteriorating classification accuracies and systematic misclassifications. The latter is crutial, as non-random misclassifications bias the dependent research \autocites[][]{odders-whiteOccurrenceConsequencesInaccurate2000}[][]{theissenTestAccuracyLee2001}.

A contending body of research \autocites{blazejewskiLocalNonParametricModel2005}{rosenthalModelingTradeDirection2012}{ronenMachineLearningTrade2022} improves trade classification performance through machine learning. The scope of current research is yet bound to the stock market and the \textit{artificial} setting, where fully-labelled trades are available. 

The goal of our empirical study is to investigate if  machine learning-based classifier improve upon the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches for option trade classification?

\section{Contributions}

% Thereby, our work addresses several addressed shortcomings.
% TODO: by how much?
Our contributions are as follows: (I) By employing gradient-boosted trees and transformers we are able to establish a new state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracy. (II) Our work is the first to consider both the supervised and the semi-supervised setting, where trades are partially-labelled. (III) Through a feature importance analysis based on Shapley values, we consistently attribute performance gains of rule-based and machine learning-based classifiers to feature groups. We discover that both paradigms share common features, but machine learning-based more effectively exploits the data. % Additional insights are gained from probing the Transformers' attention heads.

% and models trade classification using machine learning to improve upon extant rules.



% The dataset is split into three disjoint sets for training, validation, and testing. As in \textcite{ellisAccuracyTradeClassification2000} and \textcite{ronenMachineLearningTrade2022} we perform a classical train-test split, thereby maintaining the temporal ordering within the data.

% Recent works 

% Recent work of \textcite[][13--16]{grauerOptionTradeClassification2022} made significant progress in classification accuracy by proposing explicit overrides for order types and by combining multiple heuristics, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art performance in option trade classification. By this means, their approach enforces a more sophisticated decision boundary eventually leading to a more accurate classification. The fundamental constraint is, that overrides apply only to subsets of trades. Beyond heuristics, it remains open, if classifiers \emph{learned} on trade data can improve upon \emph{static} classification rules in terms of performance and robustness.

\section{Methodology}

We employ ML technology for trade classification, namely gradient-boosted trees, a wide tree-based ensemble, and the FT-Transformer \autocite{gorishniyRevisitingDeepLearning2021}, an Attention-based neural network architecture. We chose these approaches for their state-of-the-art classification performance in tabular modelling \autocites[][]{gorishniyRevisitingDeepLearning2021}[][]{grinsztajnWhyTreebasedModels2022} and their extendability to learn on partially-labelled trades.
