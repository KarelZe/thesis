“. The tick classification rule The signs of the expected price effects differ for buyer- and seller-initiated transactions. but data sources do not identify the party initiating the transaction. We rely on a tick classification rule to classify transactions as buyer- or seller-initiated, as does previous research on block trades. Transactions are assumed to be seller-initiated if they trade on a downtick and buyer-initiated if they trade on an uptick (i.e., if the change in price from the prior price to the block price is negative or positive). The sensitivity of the results to this classification rule is explored in section 5 of the paper.” (Holthausen et al., 1987, p. 8)
