### Key Takeaway
- ‚ÄúThe model shows that demand pressure in one option contract increases its price by an amount proportional to the variance of the unhedgeable part of the option. Similarly, the demand pressure increases the price of any other option by an amount proportional to the covariance of their unhedgeable parts.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=2&annotation=RLVEVZ5V))
- ‚ÄúEmpirically, we use a unique dataset to identify aggregate daily positions of dealers and end users. In particular, we define dealers as market makers and end users as proprietary traders and customers of brokers.2 We find that end users have a net long position in S&P500 index options with large net positions in out-of-the-money puts. Hence, since options are in zero net supply, dealers are short index options.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=4&annotation=PBJPIWDW))

### Data Set

‚ÄúWe acquire the data from two different sources. Data for computing net option demand were obtained directly from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). These data consist of a daily record of closing short and long open interest on all SPX and equity options for public customers and firm proprietary traders.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=17&annotation=GE898JI6))

‚ÄúThe other main source of data for this paper is the Ivy DB data set from OptionMetrics LLC. The OptionMetrics data include end-of-day volatilities implied from option prices, and we use the volatilities implied from SPX and CBOE listed equity options from the beginning of 1996 through the end of 2001. SPX options have European style exercise, and OptionMetrics computes implied volatilities by inverting the Black-Scholes formula.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=18&annotation=ZGYHPF5G))
