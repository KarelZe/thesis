## Notes 📍
- Authors discuss an ideal Bayesian trade classification appraoch. Authors view the problem of trade classification similar to Bayesian statistican with priors on the unoverservable information (buy or sell indicator), who is trying to extract trading intentions from observable trade date. (found in [[@boweNewClassicalBayesian]]) -> As this probabilistic view is similar to a probabilistic classifier it could be used to motivate my own work.
- Their BVC rule assigns a probability to a trade being either a buy or sell. (found in [[@boweNewClassicalBayesian]])
