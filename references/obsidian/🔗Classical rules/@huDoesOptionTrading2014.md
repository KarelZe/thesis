‚ÄúThis paper decomposes the total stock order imbalance into an imbalance induced by option transactions and an imbalance independent of options. The analysis shows that the option-induced imbalance significantly predicts future stock returns in the cross section controlling for the past stock and options returns, but the imbalance independent of options has only a transitory price impact.‚Äù ([Hu, 2014, p. 625](zotero://select/library/items/CWZYSMQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W366SZ9B?page=1&annotation=DHYYJ4P6))

‚ÄúThe direction of each option transaction is determined according to the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm. Over a fixed time interval (say, a day), the volume of the signed option transactions can be aggregated to generate an order flow measure for each option contract. Weighting the order flow of each option contract by its delta exposure, the paper computes a measure for aggregated delta exposure over all of the option transactions for each stock.‚Äù ([Hu, 2014, p. 626](zotero://select/library/items/CWZYSMQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W366SZ9B?page=2&annotation=ZLLASRZG))

‚ÄúTrade Alert matches each option transaction record with the underlying stock price and computes the implied volatility from a binomial tree. Following the quote rule, Trade Alert also classifies an option trade as buyer-initiated (seller-initiated) if the transaction price is above (below) the most recent mid quote price. Such comprehensive trade data enable a cross-sectional study over a relatively long period.‚Äù ([Hu, 2014, p. 631](zotero://select/library/items/CWZYSMQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W366SZ9B?page=7&annotation=UM42KTMC))
