## Notes from Sukhabaatar
(see [[@sukhbaatarAugmentingSelfattentionPersistent2019]])
Feedforward sublayer. The second element of a transformer layer is a fully connected feedforward layer. This sublayer is applied to each position $t$ in the input sequence independently, and consists of two affine transformations with a pointwise non-linear function in between:
$$
\mathrm{FF}\left(\mathbf{x}_t\right)=\mathbf{U} \sigma\left(\mathbf{V} \mathbf{x}_t+\mathbf{b}\right)+\mathbf{c},
$$
where $\sigma(x)=\max (0, x)$ is the ReLU activation function; $\mathbf{V}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ are matrices of dimension $d \times d_f$ and $d_f \times d$ respectively; $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ are the bias terms. Typically, $d_f$ is set to be 4 times larger than $d$.
Add-norm. Both the multi-head self-attention and the feed-forward layer are followed by an add-norm operation. This transformation is simply a residual connection [17] followed by layer normalization [23]. The layer normalization computes the average and standard deviation of the output activations of a given sublayer and normalizes them accordingly. This guarantees that the input $\mathbf{y}_t$ of the following sublayer is well conditioned, i.e., that $\mathbf{y}_t^T 1=0$ and $\mathbf{y}_t^T \mathbf{y}_t=\sqrt{d}$. More precisely, the AddNorm operation is defined as:
$$
\operatorname{AddNorm}\left(\mathbf{x}_t\right)=\operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{x}_t+\operatorname{Sublayer}\left(\mathbf{x}_t\right)\right) \text {, }
$$
where Sublayer is either a multi-head self-attention or a feedforward sublayer.

“Residual connection and layer normalization Besides the two sub-layers described above, the residual connection and layer normalization are also key components to the Transformer. For any vector v, the layer normalization is computed as LayerNorm(v) = γ v−μ σ + β, in which μ, σ are the mean and standard deviation of the elements in v, i.e., μ = 1 d ∑d k=1 vk and σ2 = 1 d ∑d k=1(vk − μ)2. Scale γ and bias vector β are parameters” (Xiong et al., 2020, p. 3)

“the impact of the layer normalization positions [32, 33]. There are currently two major layer normalization positions in Transformers: Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) and Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN). Pre-LN applies the layer normalization to an input for each sub-layer, and Post-LN places the layer normalization after each residual connection. The original Transformer [28] employs PostLN. However, recent studies often suggest using Pre-LN [32, 2, 5] because the training in Post-LN with deep Transformers (e.g., ten or more layers) often becomes unstable, resulting in useless models. Figure 1 shows an actual example; loss curves of training 18L-18L Transformer encoder-decoders on a widely used WMT English-to-German machine translation dataset. Here, XL-Y L represents the number of layers in encoder and decoder, where X and Y correspond to encoder and decoder, respectively. These figures clearly show that 18L-18L Post-LN Transformer encoder-decoder fails to train the model. However, in contrast, Liu et al. [13] reported that Post-LN consistently achieved better performance than Pre-LN in the machine translation task when they used 6L-6L (relatively shallow) Transformers.” (Takase et al., 2022, p. 2)


Due to the order of the layers the setup is known as the *post layer norm* (Post LN) architecture.


<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">“We use a simplified version of layer normalization where the activations are only rescaled and no additive bias is applied. After layer normalization, a residual skip connection (He et al., 2016) adds each subcomponent’s input to its output.” (Raffel et al., 2020, p. 4)</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">“Our analysis starts from the observation: the original Transformer (referred to as Post-LN) is less robust than its Pre-LN variant2 (Baevski and Auli, 2019; Xiong et al., 2019; Nguyen and Salazar, 2019).” (Liu et al., 2020, p. 1)</mark>

- motivation to switch discuss the effects of layer pre-normalization vs. post-normalization (see [[@tunstallNaturalLanguageProcessing2022]])

Both the encoder and decoder stack $L$ Transformer blocks. The specific layer arrangement is referred to as *Post Layer Normalization* (Post-LN) derived from the placement of the normalization layer.

First, we apply layer normalization before the selfattention and feedforward blocks instead of after. This small change has been unanimously adopted by all current Transformer implementations because it leads to more effective training (Baevski and Auli, 2019; Xiong et al., 2020).

(brittle training, requirement for warm-up stages)

“Different orders of the sub-layers, residual connection and layer normalization in a Transformer layer lead to variants of Transformer architectures. One of the original and most popularly used architecture for the Transformer and BERT (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018) follows “selfattention (FFN) sub-layer → residual connection → layer normalization”, which we call the Transformer with PostLayer normalization (Post-LN Transformer), as illustrated in Figure 1.” (Xiong et al., 2020, p. 3)

*Pre-LN* is known to be particullary hard

Addnorm operation.

How it's done in [[@tayEfficientTransformersSurvey2022]]:
The inputs and output of the multi-headed self-attention module are connected by residual connectors and a layer normalization layer. The output of the multi-headed selfattention module is then passed to a two-layered feed-forward network which has its inputs/outputs similarly connected in a residual fashion with layer normalization. The sublayer residual connectors with layer norm is expressed as:
$$
X=\operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(F_S(X)\right)+X
$$
where $F_S$ is the sub-layer module which is either the multi-headed self-attention or the position-wise feed-forward layers.



“Both the multi-head self-attention and the feed-forward layer are followed by an add-norm operation. This transformation is simply a residual connection [17] followed by layer normalization [23]. The layer normalization computes the average and standard deviation of the output activations of a given sublayer and normalizes them accordingly. This guarantees that the input yt of the following sublayer is well conditioned, i.e., that yT t 1 = 0 and yT t yt = √d.” (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019, p. 3)

2.3 Putting it all together (from [[@tayEfficientTransformersSurvey2022]])
Each Transformer block can be expressed as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left.X_A=\text { LayerNorm(MultiheadAttention }(X, X)\right)+X \\
& X_B=\operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\operatorname{PositionFFN}\left(X_A\right)\right)+X_A
\end{aligned}
$$
where $X$ is the input of the Transformer block and $X_B$ is the output of the Transformer block. Note that the MultiheadAttention() function accepts two argument tensors, one for query and the other for key-values. If the first argument and second argument is the same input tensor, this is the MultiheadSelfAttention mechanism.


The classical Transformer of [[@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2017]] features 

- layer norm is the same as batch norm except that it normalizes the feature dimension ([[@zhangDiveDeepLearning2021]] p. 423)

As mentioned earlier, the Transformer architecture makes use of layer normalization and skip connections. The former normalizes each input in the batch to have zero mean and unity variance. Skip connections pass a tensor to the next layer of the model without processing and add it to the processed tensor. When it comes to placing the layer normalization in the encoder or decoder layers of a transformer, there are two main choices adopted in the literature: Post layer normalization This is the arrangement used in the Transformer paper; it places layer normalization in between the skip connections. This arrangement is tricky to train from scratch as the gradients can diverge. For this reason, you will often see a concept known as learning rate warm-up, where the learning rate is gradually increased from a small value to some maximum value during training. Pre layer normalization This is the most common arrangement found in the literature; it places layer normalization within the span of the skip connections. This tends to be much more stable during training, and it does not usually require any learning rate warm-up. The difference between the two arrangements is illustrated in Figure 3-6. (unknown)

“To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyperparameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.” (Xiong et al., 2020, p. 1)

Our analysis starts from the observation: the original Transformer (referred to as Post-LN) is less robust than its Pre-LN variant2 (Baevski and Auli, 2019; Xiong et al., 2019; Nguyen and Salazar, 2019). We recognize that gradient vanishing issue is not the direct reason causing such difference, since fixing this issue alone cannot stabilize PostLN training. It implies that, besides unbalanced gradients, there exist other factors influencing model training greatly [[@liuUnderstandingDifficultyTraining2020]]

leading to a brittle optimization.

Why do we employ residual connections? add input back in. Requires the 

Besides the decoder also contains a third sub-layer.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The residual connection is crucial in the Transformer architecture for two reasons:

1.  Similar to ResNets, Transformers are designed to be very deep. Some models contain more than 24 blocks in the encoder. Hence, the residual connections are crucial for enabling a smooth gradient flow through the model.
    
2.  Without the residual connection, the information about the original sequence is lost. Remember that the Multi-Head Attention layer ignores the position of elements in a sequence, and can only learn it based on the input features. Removing the residual connections would mean that this information is lost after the first attention layer (after initialization), and with a randomly initialized query and key vector, the output vectors for position � has no relation to its original input. All outputs of the attention are likely to represent similar/same information, and there is no chance for the model to distinguish which information came from which input element. An alternative option to residual connection would be to fix at least one head to focus on its original input, but this is very inefficient and does not have the benefit of the improved gradient flow.</mark> (https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial6/Transformers_and_MHAttention.html)



<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">For a residual block $x+f(x)$, its shortcut output refers to $x$, its residual branch output refers to $f(x)$, and the dependency on its residual branch refers to $\frac{\operatorname{Var}[f(x)]}{\operatorname{Var}[x+f(x)]}$.(From [[@liuUnderstandingDifficultyTraining2020]])
</mark>


<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">“As in Figure 7, at initialization, a Pre-LN layer has roughly the same dependency on its residual branch and any previous layer, whereas a Post-LN layer has a stronger dependency on its residual branch (more discussions are elaborated in Section 4.1). We find that strong dependencies of Post-LN amplify fluctuations brought by parameter changes and destabilize the training (as in Theorem 2 and Figure 4). Besides, the loose reliance on residual branches in Pre-LN generally limits the algorithm’s potential and often produces inferior models.” (Liu et al., 2020, p. 2)</mark>


<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">“To summarize, our model is roughly equivalent to the original Transformer proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) with the exception of removing the Layer Norm bias, placing the layer normalization outside the residual path, and using a different position embedding scheme.” (Raffel et al., 2020, p. 5)</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">“Residual connections (He et al., 2016a) were first introduced to facilitate the training of deep convolutional networks, where the output of the `-th layer F` is summed with its input: x`+1 = x` + F`(x`). (1) The identity term x` is crucial to greatly extending the depth of such networks (He et al., 2016b). If one were to scale x` by a scalar λ`, then the contribution of x` to the final layer FL is (∏L−1 i=` λi)x`. For deep networks with dozens or even hundreds of layers L, the term ∏L−1 i=` λi becomes very large if λi > 1 or very small if  for enough i. When backpropagating from the last layer L back to `, these multiplicative terms can cause exploding or vanishing gradients, respectively. Therefore they fix λi = 1, keeping the total residual path an identity map.” (Nguyen and Salazar, 2019, p. 2) [[@nguyenTransformersTearsImproving2019]]</mark>

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">“Inspired by He et al. (2016b), we apply LAYERNORM immediately before each sublayer (PRENORM): x`+1 = x` + F`(LAYERNORM(x`)). (3) This is cited as a stabilizer for Transformer training (Chen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019) and is already implemented in popular toolkits (Vaswani et al., 2018; Ott et al., 2019; Hieber et al., 2018), though not necessarily used by their default recipes. Wang et al. (2019) make a similar argument to motivate the success of PRENORM in training very deep Transformers. Note that one must append an additional normalization after both encoder and decoder so their outputs are appropriately scaled.” (Nguyen and Salazar, 2019, p. 2)</mark> [[@nguyenTransformersTearsImproving2019]]

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Skip Connection bypasses the gradient exploding or vanishing problem and tries to solve the model optimization problem from the perspective of information transfer. It enables the delivery and integration of information by adding an identity mapping from the input of the neural network to the output, which may ease the optimization and allow the error signal to pass through the non-linearities.</mark> [[@liuRethinkingSkipConnection2020]]

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">“We conjecture this has caused past convergence failures (Popel and Bojar, 2018; Shazeer and Stern, 2018), with LAYERNORMs in the residual path acting similarly to λi 6= 1; furthermore, warmup was needed to let LAYERNORM safely adjust scale during early parts of training.” (Nguyen and Salazar, 2019, p. 2)</mark>

## Virtual Weights and the Residual Stream as a Communication Channel

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">One of the main features of the high level architecture of a transformer is that each layer adds its results into what we call the “residual stream.” 2 The residual stream is simply the sum of the output of all the previous layers and the original embedding. We generally think of the residual stream as a communication channel, since it doesn't do any processing itself and all layers communicate through it.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The residual stream has a deeply linear structure. 3 Every layer performs an arbitrary linear transformation to "read in" information from the residual stream at the start, 4 and performs another arbitrary linear transformation before adding to "write" its output back into the residual stream. This linear, additive structure of the residual stream has a lot of important implications. One basic consequence is that the residual stream doesn't have a ["privileged basis"](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#def-privileged-basis); we could rotate it by rotating all the matrices interacting with it, without changing model behavior.

“<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">For Transformer, it is not easy to train stacked layers on neither the encoder-side nor the decoderside. Stacking all these sub-layers prevents the efficient information flow through the network, and probably leads to the failure of training. Residual connections and layer normalization are adopted for a solution. Let F be a sub-layer in encoder or decoder, and θl be the parameters of the sub-layer.</mark>  ([[@wangLearningDeepTransformer2019]])

A residual unit is defined to be (He et al., 2016b): xl+1 = f (yl) (1) yl = xl + F (xl; θl) (2) where xl and xl+1 are the input and output of the l-th sub-layer, and yl is the intermediate output followed by the post-processing function f (·). In this way, xl is explicitly exposed to yl (see Eq. (2)). Moreover, layer normalization is adopted to reduce the variance of sub-layer output because hidden state dynamics occasionally causes a much longer training time for convergence. There are two ways to incorporate layer normalization into the residual network. • Post-Norm. In early versions of Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), layer normalization is placed after the element-wise residual addition (see Figure 1(a)), like this: xl+1 = LN(xl + F (xl; θl)) (3) where LN(·) is the layer normalization function, whose parameter is dropped for simplicity. It can be seen as a post-processing step of the output (i.e., f (x) = LN(x)). • Pre-Norm. In recent implementations (Klein et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2018; Domhan, 2018), layer normalization is applied to the input of every sub-layer (see Figure 1(b)): xl+1 = xl + F (LN(xl); θl) (4” (Wang et al., 2019, p. 1811)

“2.2 On the Importance of Pre-Norm for Deep Residual Network The situation is quite different when we switch to deeper models. More specifically, we find that prenorm is more efficient for training than post-norm if the model goes deeper. This can be explained by seeing back-propagation which <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">is the core process to obtain gradients for parameter update. Here we take a stack of L sub-layers as an example. Let E be the loss used to measure how many errors occur in system prediction, and xL be the output of the topmost sub-layer. For post-norm Transformer, given a sub-layer l, the differential of E with respect to xl can be computed by the chain rule, and we have ∂E ∂xl = ∂E ∂xL × L−1 ∏ k=l ∂LN(yk) ∂yk × L−1 ∏ k=l ( 1 + ∂F (xk; θk) ∂xk ) (5) where ∏L−1 k=l ∂ LN(yk ) ∂yk means the backward pass of the layer normalization, and ∏L−1 k=l (1 + ∂F(xk;θk) ∂xk ) means the backward pass of the sub-layer with the residual connection. Likewise, we have the gradient for pre-norm 4: ∂E ∂xl = ∂E ∂xL × ( 1+ L−1 ∑ k=l ∂F (LN(xk); θk) ∂xl ) (6) Obviously, Eq. (6) establishes a direct way to pass error gradient ∂E ∂xL from top to bottom. Its merit lies in that the number of product items on the right side does not depend on the depth of the stack. In contrast, Eq. (5) is inefficient for passing gradients back because the residual connection is not 3We need to add an additional function of layer normalization to the top layer to prevent the excessively increased value caused by the sum of unnormalized output. 4For a detailed derivation, we refer the reader to Appendix A. a bypass of the layer normalization unit (see Figure 1(a)). Instead, gradients have to be passed through LN(·) of each sub-layer. It in turn introduces term ∏L−1 k=l ∂ LN(yk ) ∂yk into the right hand side of Eq. (5), and poses a higher risk of gradient vanishing or exploring if L goes larger. This was confirmed by our experiments in which we successfully trained a pre-norm Transformer system with a 20-layer encoder on the WMT English-German task, whereas the post-norm Transformer system failed to train for a deeper encoder (Section 5.1).” (Wang et al., 2019, p. 1812)</mark>
