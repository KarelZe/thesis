Concept of market depth focuses on the volume which can be observed at the current price level [[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B49-entropy-23-00568)]. From investors’ and stock market analysts’ point o view, market depth is crucial because it can be treated as quantity dimension of market liquidity [[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B51-entropy-23-00568)]. Harris [[69](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B69-entropy-23-00568)] points out that the topic concerning dimensions of liquidity is especially interesting for practitioners as they often think about liquidity quite intuitively. Thinking about liquidity, investors usually think about trading quickly, trading large size, or trading at low costs.

According to the literature related to the microstructure of markets, several proxies of market depth are proposed: (1) depth as a number of units offered at the ask price plus a number of units at the bid price (e.g., [[46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B46-entropy-23-00568),[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B51-entropy-23-00568),[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B52-entropy-23-00568)]), (2) dollar depth calculated in currency terms (e.g., [[70](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B70-entropy-23-00568)]), (3) an average depth of the ask and the bid (e.g., [[71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B71-entropy-23-00568)]), (4) an average dollar depth measured in currency terms (e.g., [[71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B71-entropy-23-00568)]), (5) various versions of order ratio as a proxy of realized market depth (e.g., [[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B43-entropy-23-00568),[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B49-entropy-23-00568),[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B51-entropy-23-00568),[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B52-entropy-23-00568),[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147648/#B53-entropy-23-00568)]). The vast majority of these depth proxies require information about ask and bid prices.

However, although the WSE is a pure order-driven market with an electronic order book, information about ask and bid prices is not publicly available. Therefore, the side initiating a transaction cannot be directly identified from a data set. This problem concerns many emerging markets in the world, and a procedure inferring the initiator of a trade is needed in such cases.

Taking the above into consideration, this research contributes to the existing literature regarding dimensions of market liquidity by introducing and utilizing a new methodology for estimation of market depth and liquidity with the EMD indicator based on the Shannon entropy and supported by an algorithm inferring the initiator of a trade.

Propositions of new classification methods in response to the new reality of financial markets are rare. Easley et al.’s (2012) Bulk Volume Classification (BVC) algorithm is a more radical change in method that is not intended to find the trade direction of the liquidity demanding party. Chakrabarty et al. (2015) show that the BVC algorithm is inferior to the LR algorithm at that task, similarly to Panayides et al. (2014), whose results, however, depend on specific modeling choices.

Recently, Easley et al. (2012, 2016) proposed a new mechanism to classify financial markets transactions into the trading volume of informed and uninformed traders. Their method is motivated by two observations of modern financial markets: first, the classical classification algorithms, which derive the liquidity demanding party— traditionally assumed to be the informed one—for each trade, do not provide accurate results due to the effect of today’s fast markets on the data records, and second, the liquidity demander is not a uniformly valid indicator for the informed trader in the first place. Despite the second observation, the trade direction of the liquidity demanding side of the order flow remains a popular indicator of informed trading (see, e.g., Bernile et al., 2016; Chordia et al., 2017; Hu, 2014, 2017; Muravyev, 2016) the appropriateness of which is context specific but particularly sensible when informed traders demand immediacy for their transactions in order to gain most from their informational advantage. In these cases, studies rely on the classical classification algorithms, most prominently the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm, to obtain the indicator of the liquidity demanding side of the transaction, the trade initiator, as do traditional measures of market liquidity (Huang and Stoll, 1996; Fong et al., 2017). Notwithstanding the challenges posed by today’s fast markets, however, little attempts have been made to adjust or design new algorithms to obtain the trade initiator for more recent data. (https://dauphine.psl.eu/fileadmin/mediatheque/chaires/fintech/articles/1_UPDATE_Simon_Jurkatis_YFS2019.pdf)

The LR algorithm (Lee and Ready, 1991) is the most popular choice to classify trade data into the orders of the liquidity demanding and supplying sides. It compares the transaction price to the mid-point of the ask and bid quote at the time the trade took place. If the transaction price is greater (smaller) than the mid-point the liquidity demanding side is the buyer (seller), i.e. the trade is buyer-(seller-)initiated. If the transaction price is equal to the mid-point, the trade initiator is assigned according to the tick-test. That is, if the transaction price is greater (smaller) than the last price that is not equal to the current transaction price, the trade was buyer-(seller- )initiated.

For example, Finucane (2000) equates the trade initiator with the trade direction of the market order, including market-crosses for which a definition of the trade initiator is not straight forward, and finds an accuracy of 84%. Lee and Radhakrishna (2000), on the other hand, who follow a similar but more restrictive definition by excluding market-crosses, find an accuracy of 93%. Yet, only 50% of their sample qualifies for their definition. The possibility of market orders trading against each other, however, should not be of any concern given today’s fast execution times. Another identification of the trade initiator is provided by Ellis et al. (2000) and Theissen (2001) who find accuracies of 81% and 75%, respectively. Both study dealer markets and identify the trade initiator by the trade direction opposite to the dealer, because the dealer is supposed to cater to the demand of the customer. In markets where dealers play a larger role, however, there is more room for individual deviations from a standard procedure of matching orders, which are not captured by the algorithms, and dealers may not always trade passively to manage their inventory.

In this paper, I propose a new algorithm to classify transactions into the orders of liquidity demanders and suppliers and show that it outperforms the traditional alternatives, particularly under the challenging conditions of fast markets. The proposed algorithm also provides a remedy to the frequently reported deteriorating effect of time-delays between recorded trades and quotes on the classification accuracy when studying historical data.

In these cases, studies rely on the classical classification algorithms, most prominently the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm, to obtain the indicator of the liquidity demanding side of the transaction, the trade initiator, as do traditional measures of market liquidity (Huang and Stoll, 1996; Fong et al., 2017).

Examining the origin of each trade by tracing the trade to the original order introduces the concept of trade origination. **Some orders provide liquidity to the market while others take away liquidity**. This paper proposes using all the information surrounding the trade and order to determine the liquidity effect. By observing the liquidity motivation (LM) of each order, the price or time priority can be used with the order type and trades can then be classified based on their impact on liquidity immediate execution, increase liquidity and do not necessarily result in a trade, while orders that reduce the availability of shares for immediate execution demand liquidity and result in a trade. This procedure examines the inputs to the trading process to classify resulting trades, and thus the resulting classifications are source-based rather than inference-based. Even though orders are used in this paper as one of the sources of information, changes in liquidity can be observed around trades to identify the trade direction, however this method would introduce some inferences.

“One way to describe initiators is as traders who demand immediate execution (hereafter, the immediacy de"nition). A natural consequence of this de"nition is that traders placing market orders (or limit orders at the opposite quote) are labeled the initiators, and traders placing limit orders are viewed as non-initiators or passive suppliers of liquidity” (Odders-White, 2000, p. 261)

“Classification Methods and Previous Analyses Trade classification infers which trade participant initiated a trade by being the aggressor, consistent with Odders-White (2000) defining the laterarriving order as the trade initiator.” ([[@rosenthalModelingTradeDirection2012]], p. 3) -> adapts definition of Odders-and White

“Firm proprietary traders sometimes are end users of options and sometimes are liquidity suppliers. Consequently, we compute net end-user demand for an option in two different ways. First, we assume that firm proprietary traders are end users and compute the net demand for an option as the sum of the public customer and firm proprietary trader long open interest minus the sum of the public customer and firm proprietary trader short open interest. We refer to net demand computed in this way as non-market-maker net demand. Second, we assume that the firm proprietary traders are liquidity suppliers and compute the net demand for an option as the public customer long open interest minus the public customer short open interest. We refer to net demand computed in this second way as public customer net demand. The results are similar for non-market-maker net demand and public customer net demand” (Gârleanu et al., 2009, p. 16)
