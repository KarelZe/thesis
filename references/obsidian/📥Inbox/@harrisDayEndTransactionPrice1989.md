## Annotations 📖
“To determine whether the day-end effect is a trading effect, the transaction prices must be classified into observations on bids and asks. The classification method used here, classifies transaction prices by their position relative to the most recent quoted bid and ask. A within-spread-location variable, Q = 2 (Price - Ask)/Spread +1, is computed. It takes a value of 1 if the transaction occurred at the last ask price, - 1 if at the last bid, and 0 if at exactly the spread midpoint. The frequency distribution of the sign of Q, by transaction, is presented in Figure 2. Conditional on the classification method, the frequency of ask prices clearly increases at day-end.” (Harris, 1989, p. 41)
