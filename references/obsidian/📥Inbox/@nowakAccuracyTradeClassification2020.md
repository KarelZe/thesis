‚ÄúSuch indication made directly from the data is nowadays in mostly cases inaccessible, since the majority of public databases including transaction data do not contain information of trade initiators and trade direction.‚Äù ([Nowak, 2020, p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/Y4X4RNQJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7F3WRAW?page=1&annotation=YX7ANFT2))

‚ÄúThe information which party to a trade is a trade initiator is indispensable to specify the trade indicator models used to investigate the intraday price formation S.

‚Äú66 S. Nowak (Glosten and Harris 1988; Huang and Stoll 1997; Madhavan 1992; McGroarty et al. 2007; Hagstr√∂mer et al. 2016). Moreover, the identification of party to a trade which is responsible for initiating a particular transaction is advantageous to clarify many important issues related to the market microstructure. First of all, it may be used to ascertain the information content of trades. Second, it can help to figure out the magnitude of the order imbalance as well as the proportion of the inventory accumulation made by the liquidity suppliers. Third, it helps to assess the price impact of large in volume transactions as well as the magnitude of effective spread (Ellis et al. 2000).‚Äù ([Nowak, 2020, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/Y4X4RNQJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7F3WRAW?page=2&annotation=BSS8JS7B))

‚ÄúWe will consequently follow an approach employed in the paper of Mi≈Çob Ã® edzki and Nowak (2018) and classify a particular trade as initiated by a buyer (seller) if its resulting price is equal to the best ask (bid) or higher (lower) than that. It is pertinent to note that another attitudes are to be found in the literature: i.e., an investor is assessed to be a trade initiator if he (she) places either a market order or places his (her) order chronologically last. A trade initiator as also understood as the last party to agree to the trade or the party whose decision causes the trade to occur (Lee and Radhakrishna 2000; Odders-White 2000; Chakrabarty et al. 2012).‚Äù ([Nowak, 2020, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/Y4X4RNQJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7F3WRAW?page=2&annotation=IQYAQ9EC))
