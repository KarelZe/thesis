## Trade Direction
“hat the mean of the trade direction (buy = 1, sell = −1) is −0.034 implies there are slightly more seller-initiated trades (51.7%) than buyer-initiated trades (48.3%). The trade direction is determined by the quote rule, and if a trade price is at the NBBO midpoint then the quote rule is applied to the best quotes of the reporting exchange.” (Muravyev and Pearson, 2020, p. 4980)
