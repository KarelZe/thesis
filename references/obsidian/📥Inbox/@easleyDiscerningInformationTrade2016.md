## Notes 📍
- Authors discuss an ideal Bayesian trade classification appraoch. Authors view the problem of trade classification similar to Bayesian statistican with priors on the unoverservable information (buy or sell indicator), who is trying to extract trading intentions from observable trade date. (found in [[@boweNewClassicalBayesian]]) -> As this probabilistic view is similar to a probabilistic classifier it could be used to motivate my own work.
- Their BVC rule assigns a probability to a trade being either a buy or sell. (found in [[@boweNewClassicalBayesian]])
- BVC is illsuited for my task, as we require to sign each trade?

“the bulk volume classification (BVC) methodology and tick rules. Tick rule approaches use simple movements in trade prices (upticks or downticks) to classify a trade as either a buy or a sell. The 2 This problem is also particularly acute in the new swap trading markets. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act currently requires reporting of nonblock trades to the Swap Data Repository, but current reporting rules allow a 30-minute delay. So there is no way to determine the correct order of trades. See also Ding, Hanna, and Hendershot (2014) for evidence on how speed differences between proprietary feeds and the consolidated tape complicate knowing current quotes. 3 See Hasbrouck (2013) for an excellent analysis of quote volatility and its implications. 4 These changes also mean that trade information will not be linked with other variables of interest such as trader identity. For example, Lee and Radhakrishnan (2000) and Campbell, Ramdorai, and Schwartz (2008) propose size cutoff rules on trades that they argue identify institutional trading. Even using data from the year 2000, Campbell, Ramdorai, and Schwartz note problems in identification arising from what they suspect was algorithmic trading. With trade sizes now all collapsing to minimum levels, and institutions trading dynamically with limit orders, inferring trader identity from trade size is a daunting task. bulk volume technique, which was first applied in Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O’Hara (2011), aggregates trades over short time or volume intervals and then uses a standardized price change between the beginning and end of the interval to approximate the percentage of buy and sell order flow. Each of these techniques maps observable data into proxies for trading intentions, but how well any of these approaches works in the new high frequency world is unclear.” ([Easley et al., 2016, p. 270](zotero://select/library/items/X6ZNZ556)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPC6KBMF?page=2&annotation=6Q5JXH46))

“A Bayesian statistician would start with a prior on the unobservable information, observe the data, and use a likelihood function to update his or her prior to form a posterior on the underlying information. This is not what a tick rule does. It classifies a trade as a buy if the previous price is below the current price, a sell, if it is above. The bulk volume approach, by contrast, can be thought of as assigning a posterior probability to a trade being a buy or sell, an approach closer conceptually to Bayes’ rule.” ([Easley et al., 2016, p. 270](zotero://select/library/items/X6ZNZ556)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPC6KBMF?page=2&annotation=8WU3R2SV))

“Using a statistical model, we investigate the errors that arise from a tick rule approach and the bulk volume approach, relative to a Bayesian approach. We show that when the noise in the data is low, tick rule errors can be relatively low, and over some regions the tick rule can perform better than the bulk volume approach. When noise is substantial, the bulk volume approach can outperform a tick rule and permit more accurate sorting of the data.” ([Easley et al., 2016, p. 270](zotero://select/library/items/X6ZNZ556)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPC6KBMF?page=2&annotation=VDMJDEGC))

“As with any research, our analysis has limitations that should be kept in mind when evaluating our results. We use futures data in our empirical analysis because the nature of futures trading is more easily related to the results of our statistical model. The implications of our model should apply to other markets, but implementation issues for the bulk volume approach can be nontrivial in some market settings.” ([Easley et al., 2016, p. 271](zotero://select/library/items/X6ZNZ556)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPC6KBMF?page=3&annotation=R6RLLF7V))

“The tick rule produces a list 7 We use the t-distribution because the parameters of the true distribution are unknown. Other distributions, such as the normal or the actual empirical distribution of the data, can be used, but in empirical testing we found little improvement over results from the t-distribution. Based on calibration, we used df = 0.25 to account for the fat tails present in the data. of buy and sell classifications, one for each trade, and BVC produces a list of fractions of buys and sells, one for each bar (time, volume, or trade) to which it is applied.” ([Easley et al., 2016, p. 272](zotero://select/library/items/X6ZNZ556)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPC6KBMF?page=4&annotation=9QM7VVKH))

“We consider three methodologies to assign a probability that the underlying trade type was a buy or a sell given the observation of a single draw of : Bayes’ rule, the tick rule, and BVC specialized to a single observation. The tick rule assigns probability one or zero to the trade having been a buy.” ([Easley et al., 2016, p. 272](zotero://select/library/items/X6ZNZ556)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPC6KBMF?page=4&annotation=E9GPBVPP))

“Much of market microstructure analysis is built on the concept that traders learn from market data. Some of this learning is prosaic, such as inferring buys and sells from trade execution. Other learning is more complex, such as inferring underlying new information from trade executions. In this paper, we investigate the general issue of how to discern underlying information from trading data. We examine the accuracy and efficacy of three methods for classifying trades: the tick rule, the aggregated tick rule, and the bulk volume classification methodology. Our results indicate that the tick rule is a reasonably good classifier of the aggressor side of trading, both for individual trades and in aggregate. Bulk volume is shown to also be reasonably accurate for classifying buy and sell trades, but, unlike the tick-based approaches, it can also provide insight into other proxies for underlying information.” ([Easley et al., 2016, p. 284](zotero://select/library/items/X6ZNZ556)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HPC6KBMF?page=16&annotation=VC98DC2N))
