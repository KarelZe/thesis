## Annotations 📖

“The deep component is a feed-forward neural network, as shown in Figure 1 (right). For categorical features, the original inputs are feature strings (e.g., “language=en”). Each of these sparse, high-dimensional categorical features are first converted into a low-dimensional and dense real-valued vector, often referred to as an embedding vector. The dimensionality of the embeddings are usually on the order of O(10) to O(100). The embedding vectors are initialised randomly and then the values are trained to minimise the final loss function during model training. These low-dimensional dense embedding vectors are then fed into the hidden layers of a neural network in the forward pass.” ([Cheng et al., 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/EZUKWCIB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QGHKZ7UB?page=2&annotation=KS6UM9FZ))
