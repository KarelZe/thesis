### Key Takeaway
- ‚ÄúThe model shows that demand pressure in one option contract increases its price by an amount proportional to the variance of the unhedgeable part of the option. Similarly, the demand pressure increases the price of any other option by an amount proportional to the covariance of their unhedgeable parts.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=2&annotation=RLVEVZ5V))
- ‚ÄúEmpirically, we use a unique dataset to identify aggregate daily positions of dealers and end users. In particular, we define dealers as market makers and end users as proprietary traders and customers of brokers.2 We find that end users have a net long position in S&P500 index options with large net positions in out-of-the-money puts. Hence, since options are in zero net supply, dealers are short index options.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=4&annotation=PBJPIWDW))

### Data Set

‚ÄúWe use a unique dataset to identify aggregate daily positions of dealers and end-users. In particular, we define dealers as market-makers and end-users as proprietary traders and customers of brokers.2 We are the first to document that end-users have a net long position in S&P 500 index options with large net positions in out-of-the-money (OTM) puts.‚Äù (G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 4261)

‚ÄúWe acquire the data from two different sources. Data for computing net option demand were obtained directly from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). These data consist of a daily record of closing short and long open interest on all SPX and equity options for public customers and firm proprietary traders.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=17&annotation=GE898JI6))

‚ÄúThe other main source of data for this paper is the Ivy DB data set from OptionMetrics LLC. The OptionMetrics data include end-of-day volatilities implied from option prices, and we use the volatilities implied from SPX and CBOE listed equity options from the beginning of 1996 through the end of 2001. SPX options have European style exercise, and OptionMetrics computes implied volatilities by inverting the Black-Scholes formula.‚Äù ([G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/U4LJ77Z9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKI84IS2?page=18&annotation=ZGYHPF5G))

## Index vs. equity options

‚ÄúThe end-user demand for index options can help to explain the two puzzles that index options appear to be expensive, and that low-moneyness options seem to be especially expensive (Rubinstein 1994; Longstaff 1995; Bates 2000; Jackwerth 2000; Coval and Shumway 2001; Bondarenko 2003; Amin, Coval, and Seyhun 2004; Driessen and Maenhout 2008). In the time series, the model-based impact of demand for index options is positively related to their expensiveness, measured by the difference between their implied volatility and the volatility measure of Bates (2006). Indeed, we estimate that on the order of one-third of index-option expensiveness can be accounted for by demand effects.5‚Äù (G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 4261)

‚ÄúAnother option-pricing puzzle is the significant difference between indexoption prices and the prices of single-stock options, despite the relative similarity of the underlying distributions (e.g., Bakshi, Kapadia, and Madan 2003; Bollen and Whaley 2004). In particular, single-stock options appear cheaper and their smile is flatter. Consistently, we find that the demand pattern for single-stock options is very different from that of index options. For instance, end-users are net short single-stock options‚Äînot long, as in the case of index options. Demand patterns further help to explain the cross-sectional pricing of single-stock options. Indeed, individual stock options are relatively cheaper for stocks with more negative demand for options.‚Äù (G√¢rleanu et al., 2009, p. 4262)
