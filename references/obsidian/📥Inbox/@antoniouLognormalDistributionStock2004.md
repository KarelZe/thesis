## Notes üìç
- They propose a new indicator or stachstic variable $\Xi$, which is defined as the closing price normalised by the volume. The variable $\Theta$ has a stable mean and dispersion, compared to its nominator and denominator.
- The resulting distribution roughly matches a lognormal distribution. 
- The goodness of fit can be measured with the $\chi^2$ test with certain degrees of freedom.
- They approximate the lognormal distribution with:
$$
f(x)=\frac{A}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma x} \exp ^{-\left(1 / 2 \sigma^2\right)(\ln x-\mu)^2}.
$$

## Annotations üìñ
‚ÄúIn Section 3, we show that for some stock market data the statistical distributionof the closing prices normalised by corresponding traded volumes (‚Äúprice/volume‚Äù ratio) 1ts well the log-normal law.‚Äù ([Antoniou et al., 2004, p. 618](zotero://select/library/items/X5DBX927)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2UH6YXLZ?page=3&annotation=V34PBRUM))

‚ÄúAiming to minimise the in=uence of the trend, we introduce a new stochastic variable , which is the closing price normalised by the corresponding traded volume (price/volume). The variable (see left bottom plots inFigs. 3‚Äì9) has a relatively stable mean value and dispersion, compared to the original time series of closing prices and traded volumes.‚Äù ([Antoniou et al., 2004, p. 620](zotero://select/library/items/X5DBX927)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2UH6YXLZ?page=5&annotation=CKPYGLQ4))

‚ÄúIn order to test the hypothesis on the correspondence of these statistical distributions to the log-normal law, they are approximated by (see, for example, Refs. [3,10]) f(x)= A ‚àö2x exp‚àí(1=22)(ln x‚àí )2 ;‚Äù ([Antoniou et al., 2004, p. 621](zotero://select/library/items/X5DBX927)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2UH6YXLZ?page=6&annotation=36XKPPGV))

‚ÄúThe quality of approximationis represented by the value  
2=ndf , where ‚Äúndf‚Äù is the number of degrees of freedom.‚Äù ([Antoniou et al., 2004, p. 622](zotero://select/library/items/X5DBX927)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2UH6YXLZ?page=7&annotation=ILEV494H))
