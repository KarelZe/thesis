## Notes 
- Authors provide formal arguments and a lower bound for the use of the tick test. Tick test performs better than random choice.
- Can not tell if proof is correct / makes sense. Seldomly cited.

## Annotations
‚ÄúBy analyzing the derived equation, we provide formal arguments for the use of the tick test by proving that it is bounded to perform better than chance (50/50) and that the set of rules from the tick test provides an unbiased estimator of the trade signs.‚Äù ([Perlin et al., 2014, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/JM4B69TC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SL84UJ76?page=1&annotation=YTH4GIHK))

‚ÄúThis paper is a seminal work in the literature as it was the first to formally study the inference of trade direction based on incomplete data.‚Äù ([Perlin et al., 2014, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/JM4B69TC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SL84UJ76?page=2&annotation=GULESAR8))

‚ÄúNotice that the work of Finucane (2000) already shows some of the findings presented in this paper, specifically that the spread will contribute in a positive way to the performance of the tick test (i.e., the higher the spread, the higher the accuracy of this particular method of prediction of the sign of a trade)‚Äù ([Perlin et al., 2014, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/JM4B69TC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SL84UJ76?page=2&annotation=24SZ9NV8))
