## Annotations 📖

“This classification of trade types provides two advantages over the data sets that have been used previously. First, we know with certainty the ‘‘sign’’ of the trading volume. By contrast, the existing literature on the informational content of option trading volume at best infers the sign, with some error, from quote and trade information using the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm.14 Second, unlike the previous literature, we know whether the initiator of observed volume is opening a new option position or closing one that he or she already had outstanding.” (Pan and Poteshman, 2006, p. 882)
