## Annotations 📖
Note: 

“They also compute a liquidity premium per trade based on the absolute difference between the trade price and the quote "midspread."” ([Lee, 1993, p. 1016](zotero://select/library/items/QMJI4B6K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YFZIMMTT?page=8&annotation=DT3XB943))

“In the first set of tests, the liquidity premium for each trade is computed as the absolute difference between the actual trade price and the "midspread" (average of bid and ask prices) of the prevailing quote at the time of the trade. Assuming that, on average, the specialist's spread is set symmetrically around the equilibrium price, the liquidity premium provides an estimate of the effective "half-spread" for each trade."” ([Lee, 1993, p. 1018](zotero://select/library/items/QMJI4B6K)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YFZIMMTT?page=10&annotation=92M79LI2))
