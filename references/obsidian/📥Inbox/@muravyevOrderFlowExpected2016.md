### Dataset

‚ÄúOPRA does not report option trade direction, and thus I infer this by applying the quote rule to the NBBO. If the trade is at the midpoint of the NBBO, the quote rule is applied to the best bid offer (BBO) from the exchange at which the trade occurs. In the Internet Appendix, I argue that this algorithm has small estimation error.‚Äù ([Muravyev, 2016, p. 688](zotero://select/library/items/5Q2232XU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RVHGHBH8?page=16&annotation=5XAHY95U))

‚ÄúThe data only include transactions that were executed at ISE; however, throughout most of the sample period, ISE was the largest equity options exchange with a market share of about 30%. OptionMetrics is a common source of price information on equity options. For each option contract, it contains end-of-day best bid and ask prices as well as other information such as volume, open interest, implied volatility, and option Greeks. Returns and volume for the underlying stocks are also taken from OptionMetrics to avoid data loss from merging with CRSP.‚Äù ([Muravyev, 2016, p. 688](zotero://select/library/items/5Q2232XU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RVHGHBH8?page=16&annotation=XU4RCY39))
