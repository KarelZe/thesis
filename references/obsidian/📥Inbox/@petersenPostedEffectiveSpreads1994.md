‚ÄúWhen trades are executed inside the posted bid-ask spread, the posted spread is no longer an accurate measure of transactions costs faced by investors.‚Äù ([Petersen and Fialkowski, 1994, p. 209](zotero://select/library/items/2CQEEYUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ICR74ERY?page=1&annotation=J2HT2P2F))

‚ÄúIn the simple security markets described in standard financial models [e.g., Roll (1984)], trades take place at the prices posted by the specialist. Since market orders purchase stock at the ask and sell stock at the bid, these orders pay the spread between the bid and the ask. The spread arises due to the costs of Correspondence fo: Mitchell Petersen, GSB, University of Chicago, 1101 E. 58th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. \*Petersen acknowledges financial support from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago.

‚Äú270 M.A. Petersen and D. Fialkowski, Posted versus effective spreads maintaining inventories [Ho and Stoll (1981)], and because liquidity providers face some traders who know more about the future value of the security than they [Treynor (1971) and Glosten and Milgrom (1985)]. In U.S. equity markets, however, trades inside the spread are a frequent occurrence.‚Äù ([Petersen and Fialkowski, 1994, p. 210](zotero://select/library/items/2CQEEYUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ICR74ERY?page=2&annotation=SYKCWV7Y))

‚ÄúMarket orders may transact inside the spread if the specialist does not always display the best public limit orders. Market orders may also trade at prices better than the posted quotes when they are matched with other market orders. Once trades occur inside the posted spread, the posted spread overstates an investor‚Äôs expected trading costs. Since investors can expect to buy at prices lower than the ask and sell at prices higher than the bid, the effective spread is the relevant measure of trading costs.‚Äù ([Petersen and Fialkowski, 1994, p. 210](zotero://select/library/items/2CQEEYUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ICR74ERY?page=2&annotation=XWH4JZH6))

‚ÄúLee (1993) and Blume and Goldstein (1992b) compare transaction prices to the midpoint of the quoted spread. This method accurately estimates the effective spread only when market orders are matched solely with limit orders (the specialist or a public limit order). If market orders are matched with each other, then this method will overestimate the spread actually paid. Some of the market orders will pay significantly less than the posted spread.‚Äù ([Petersen and Fialkowski, 1994, p. 210](zotero://select/library/items/2CQEEYUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ICR74ERY?page=2&annotation=YUGHMMXD))

‚ÄúSince these stocks are traded on many exchanges, there are many bids and asks for each equity issue.

Across all exchanges the best bid is the highest bid price; the best offer is the lowest ask price.‚Äù ([Petersen and Fialkowski, 1994, p. 215](zotero://select/library/items/2CQEEYUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ICR74ERY?page=7&annotation=63N3SZC9))

‚ÄúTo capture the true spread faced by traders, we use the measured price improvement to calculate the effective spread.‚Äù ([Petersen and Fialkowski, 1994, p. 215](zotero://select/library/items/2CQEEYUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ICR74ERY?page=7&annotation=9HZCDK8E))

‚ÄúA trader may receive price improvement both buying and selling. Thus, an estimate of the effective spread faced by a trader is Effective spread = Posted spread - 2 x Price improvement. (3) Intuitively, the effective spread is the expected purchase price minus the expected sales price.‚Äù ([Petersen and Fialkowski, 1994, p. 215](zotero://select/library/items/2CQEEYUA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ICR74ERY?page=7&annotation=FU66S8PN))
