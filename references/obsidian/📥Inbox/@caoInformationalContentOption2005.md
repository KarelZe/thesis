“To appreciate the informational content of option and stock volume, we examine buyer- and seller-initiated volume. The BODB, ISSM, and TAQ have no information on whether a trade is buyer or seller initiated, one must use intraday trade and quote data to classify trades. We adopt an algorithm similar to the ones used by Lee and Ready (1991) for stock trades and by Vijh (1990), Amin and Lee (1997), and Easley et al. (1998) for option trades. Specifically, we assign a trade as a buy (sell) if it occurs above (below) the bid-ask midpoint. For trades executed at the bid-ask midpoints, we classify the trade as a buy (sell) if its trade price is higher (lower) than its preceding price. All other trades are classified as cross-trades and excluded.” (Cao et al., 2005, p. 1079)
