One of the first works who mention the tick test is [[@holthausenEffectLargeBlock1987]] (referred to as tick classification rule) or [[@hasbrouckTradesQuotesInventories1988]] (referred to as transaction rule)

“The simplest approximation is the tick rule, which assigns a trade to be a buy if the trade price was an uptick relative to the previous trade and to be a sell if it was a downtick. (In the case of a zero-tick, the signing relies on the movement relative to the last price change.)” (Easley et al., 2016, p. 271)

“his approach eschews any distributional assumptions and relies instead on the basic notion that buys raise prices and sells lower them. But how well this approximation works to infer trades, or underlying information, is debatable,” ([[@easleyDiscerningInformationTrade2016]], p. 271)

**Algorithm:** Formal description in [[@olbrysEvaluatingTradeSide2018]] and [[@carrionTradeSigningFast2020]] (see below) and [[@jurkatisInferringTradeDirections2022]]:
Formally denoting the trade price of security $i$ at time $t$ as $P_{i, t}$ and $\Delta P_{i, t}$ as the price change between two successive trades and the assigned trade direction at time $t$ as Trade, we have:
If $\Delta P_{i, t}>0$, Trade $_{i, t}=$ Buy,
If $\Delta P_{i, t}<0$, Trade $_{i, t}=$ Sell,
If $\Delta P_{i, t}=0$, Trade $_{i, t}=$ Trade $_{i, t-1}$.

**Informal description:** Tick tests use changes in trade prices and look at previous trade prices to infer trade direction. If the trade occurs at a higher price, hence uptick, as the previous trade its classified as as buyer-initiated. If the trade occurs at a lower price its seller-initiated. If the price change is zero, the last price is taken, that is different from the current price. (see e. g., [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]] or [[@finucaneDirectTestMethods2000]] or [[@leeInferringTradeDirection1991]] for similar framing)

“The tick test is a technique which infers the direction of a trade by comparing its price to the price of the preceding trade@).The test classifies each trade into four categories: an uptick, a downtick, a zero-uptick, and a zero-downtick. A trade is an uptick (downtick) if the price is higher (lower) than the price of the previous trade. When the price is the same as the previous trade (a zero tick), if the last price change was an uptick, then the trade is a zero-uptick.Similarly,if the last price change was a downtick, then the trade is a zero-downtick” ([[@leeInferringTradeDirection1991]], p. 3)

“The tick rule is the simplest classification algorithm due to its neglect of quote data. Trades with a higher price than the previous (upticks) are classified as buys; trades with a lower price (downticks) are sells. In the case of equal prices, the last preceding price change is used. The tick rule is part of every complex trade-by-trade classification algorithm” ([[@poppeSensitivityVPINChoice2016]] p. 166)

**Variant:** 
-  The reverse tick test is similar, but uses the next trade price to classify the current trade. If the next trade occurs on an uptick or zero uptick, the current trade is classified as a sell. If the next trade occurs on a downtick or zero downtick, the current trade is classified as a buy.” (Finucane, 2000, p. 557)
- A variant of the tick test is the *reverse tick test* as popularized by [[@leeInferringTradeDirection1991]]. Instead of using the previous distinguishable trade price, the subsequent trade price, that is different from the current trade is used. 
- Instead of the previous trade, the reverse tick rule uses the subsequent trade price to classify the current trade. 
- If the next trade price that is different from the current price, is below the current price the trade (on a down tick or zero down tick) is classified as buyer-initiated. If the next distinguishable price is above the current price (up tick or zero up tick), the current price the trade is seller-initiated. (loosely adapted from [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]]) (see also [[@leeInferringTradeDirection1991]])
- “When quote data is not present, the TR yields a considerably lower accuracy.” (Frömmel et al., 2021, p. 9)
**Lower bound:** [[@perlinPerformanceTickTest2014]] proved that the tick test performs better than random chance. 
**Data efficiency:** low data requirements, as only transaction data is needed. (see [[@theissenTestAccuracyLee2000]]). Could be good enough though. 
**Data efficiency:** “The tick rule is the simplest classification algorithm due to its neglect of quote data. Trades with a higher price than the previous (upticks) are classified as buys; trades with a lower price (downticks) are sells. In the case of equal prices, the last preceding price change is used. The tick rule is part of every complex trade-by-trade classification algorithm” ([Pöppe et al., 2016, p. 166](zotero://select/library/items/5A83SDDB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4XIK47X6?page=2&annotation=SRLPERF8))
**Data efficienth:** “The advantages of the tick method are that it requires only transaction data (quotes are not necessary) and that no trades are left unclassifed. The disadvantage is that the tick method incorporates less information than the quote method since it does not use the posted quotes.” ([[@odders-whiteOccurrenceConsequencesInaccurate2000]], 2000, p. 264)


**Why the limitation:** “We compare the accuracy rates of various algorithms in classifying ECN trades. We divide trades according to their price distribution relative to quotes. We expect the classification rules to perform better when trades occur at the ask or bid. When trades receive price improvement, buys and sells will execute at prices inside the quotes. In these instances, not only does the quote rule meet with some challenge, the tick rule will also be more difficult as buys (sells) will more likely occur on downticks (upticks).” ([[@chakrabartyTradeClassificationAlgorithms2007]]., 2007, p. 3811)


**Limitations:** “Figure 1 illustrates how trades can be misclassified when quotes change. When quotes rise between trades, sales at the bid on upticks and zero upticks will be misclassified as buys by the tick test, but should be correctly classified using quote-based methods. Trade 6a in Panel A of Figure 1 illustrates the case of a sell (at the bid) being misclassified by the tick test on a zero uptick. If quotes are falling, as is the case for trade 6b in Panel B, buys at the ask on downticks and zero downticks will be misclassified as sells by the tick test, and should be correctly classified by quote-based methods. Figure 1 also illustrates the tendency for mid-spread trades to be misclassified by the tick test, even when quotes do not” (Finucane, 2000, p. 557)

“change. Trade 4a, a sale that occurs on an uptick, is misclassified as a buy, and trade 5b, a buy that occurs on a downtick with constant quotes, is misclassified as a sell.

Trade direction is indicated below each trade. Panel A illustrates the case where sells on upticks and zero upticks are misclassified by the tick test when quotes are increasing. Panel B illustrates the case where buys on downticks and zero downticks are misclassified when quotes are falling. Panel B also demonstrates how m” (Finucane, 2000, p. 558)

**Limitation:** “Additionally, trade direction may not always be unambiguously determined. While LR assume that trades generally occur only when a market buy or sell order arrives, trades that do not involve market orders also can occur, such as when two limit orders are crossed. Although the trade can be classified by the tick test or LR's algorithm, the true direction of the trade is ambiguous. Classifying such trades as buys or sells may lead to erroneous conclusions in empirical studies.” (Finucane, 2000, p. 559)

**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒“In theory, all trades can be classified as either a buy or a sell order by using a tick test.5In practice, certain trades are not classifiable because they are either reported out of sequence or are sold with special conditions attached” ([[@leeInferringTradeDirection1991]], p. 3)
**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒“The primary limitation of the tick test is its relative imprecision when compared to a quote-based approach, particularly if the prevailing quote has changed or it has been a long time since the last trade.” ([[@leeInferringTradeDirection1991]], p. 3)
**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒“In theory, all trades can be classified as either a buy or a sell order by using a tick test.5In practice, certain trades are not classifiable because they are either reported out of sequence or are sold with special conditions attached” (Lee and Ready, 1991, p. 3)

**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒“First, options are much more illiquid than stocks with many series not recording a trade for days or weeks. For that reason, tick rules that depend on the information from preceding or succeeding trades might be problematic.” ([[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]], 2022, p. 1)
**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒Tick test can not handle if two trades do not involve market orders e. g. two limit orders. In such a case the tick rule could be applied, but there is ambiguous. (see [[@finucaneDirectTestMethods2000]])
**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒 “For example, the quote rule is unable to classify trades occurring at the bid-ask spread midpoint, but the tick rule cannot classify the opening trade of the day (and any subsequent trades at an identical price)” ([[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]], 2003, p. 882)
**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒“Each of the four classification methods cannot classify some trades. The quote rule is unable to classify midspread trades. The tick rule cannot classify the first trade of the day for a given security. If the second trade of the day takes place at the same price as the first one, both trades cannot be classified by the tick rule. The LR and EMO rules also lose some trades since they are combinations of the tick and the quote rules.” ([[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]], 2003, p. 886) 
**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒 “However, in the presence of greater uncertainty when trading potentially generates a greater price impact (resulting from order flow imbalances), our trade classification indicator often diverges significantly from those using the Tick rule. Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O’Hara (2016) maintain that Tick rule classifications appear particularly problematic in periods of high volatility exhibiting imbalances in order flow.” ([[@boweNewClassicalBayesian]], 2018, p. 30)

**Limitations:** 👩‍🚒“But applying it can lead to misclassifications if quotes move in a direction opposite to the trade direction or if traded prices move through the best bid or ask levels.” ([Pöppe et al., 2016, p. 166](zotero://select/library/items/5A83SDDB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4XIK47X6?page=2&annotation=MXT9P3U7))


**Bias in selection:** “As the probability of observing only buy trades or only sell trades decreases with an increasing number of trades, the number of trades per option day is lower and the time between two trades is higher in our matched samples compared to their full sample equivalents. Because tick tests depend on the information from preceding or succeeding trades as a precise signal for the fair option price, our results might therefore underestimate their performance.” ([[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]]., 2022, p. 9)

**Results:** 💸 “All four rules perform worst when applied to index options, and best with equity options. The poor performance of the tick rule is a consequence of the fact that only 59.7% (58.7%) of all option buys (sells) occur on an uptick (downtick).” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 886)
**Results:** 💸 “This implies that the sample used for assessing the performance of the tick rule will consist of a higher proportion of index option trades (because some equity options trade infrequently and cannot be classified by the tick rule) and will be significantly smaller. Therefore, the performance measure will be biased downward for the tick rule.” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 887)
**Results:** 💸 “When the tick rule is not “reset” at the beginning of each day, the number of trades classified by the rule increases (as expected), but the classification precision does not improve: only 55.73% of all 1,404,365 classifiable trades are labeled correctly by the tick rule.” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 886)
**Results:** 💸 “Specifically, the only difference between the tick and the EMO rules is that the latter uses the quote rule for at-the-quote trades. Consequently, the EMO method outperforms the tick rule only for those trades. Similarly, the LR and EMO methods treat at-the-quote and at-midspread trades exactly the same, but the LR approach applies the quote rule to all other trades.” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 891)
**Results: 💸 “Generally, quote rules outperform tick rules by far. For the tick rule, a higher success rate can be achieved using prices across all exchanges and information from subsequent trades” (Grauer et al., 2022, p. 3) -> lead them to propose the [[🔢Depth Rule]].
**Results:** 💸 “For example, Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O’Hara (2012) show that the tick test works reasonably well for e-mini S&P 500 Futures, correctly classifying 86% of the trades, but it is less accurate in gold futures (79%) and in oil futures (67%).” (Grauer et al., 2022, p. 5)
**Effective spread:** “The tick rule severely underestimates effective spread. This is a consequence of the method’s classifying correctly just slightly more than half of all trades.” ([[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]], 2003, p. 896)
