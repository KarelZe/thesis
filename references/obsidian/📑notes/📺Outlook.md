  Outlook  Further research  further possible practical, political, socio-economic developments  Our Recommendations: For the chapter “Conclusion” it is important to make the link to the questions asked at the beginning of the paper in the “Introduction” chapter. Every question should be answered as a corresponding conclusion based on the evaluated results (i.e. based on the Results and Discussion section(s)). The following recommendations can often be valid for both scientific work and practical implementation/application. During the research, possibly new questions occur which could not be solved within the limited time period of the current project. Thus, an outlook for further research needs can be drawn.
