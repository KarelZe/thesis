## Annotations 📖
“The goal ofsemi-sup ervised classifcation is to use unlabeled data to improve the generalization. The cluster assumption states that the decision boundary should notcross high densityregions, but instead lie in low density regions. We believe that virtually all successful semi-supervised algorithms utilize the cluster assumption, though most of the time indirectly.” ([Chapelle and Zien, 2005, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/3TNHTXNL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RMGB854L?page=1&annotation=UB7GWKHB))
