# Notes Sebastian Raschka
-   No code available, so results are not directly reproducible and must be taken with a grain of salt.
-   The paper proposes a contrastive loss for self-supervised learning for tabular data
-   Experiments were done on 69 classification datasets, and the results showed that the self-supervised approach is an improvement compared to purely supervised approaches.
