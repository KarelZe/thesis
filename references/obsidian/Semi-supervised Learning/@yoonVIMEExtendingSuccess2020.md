## Notes Sebastian Raschka
-   VIME (Value Imputation and Mask Estimation) includes self- and semi-supervised learning frameworks for tabular data.
-   The authors provide good ablation studies showing that the semi-supervised learning variant of VIME is better than the supervised-only and self-supervised-only variants. The best VIME variant uses both self- and semi-supervised learning and outperforms XGBoost on all datasets.
-   The comparison is based on only five datasets.
