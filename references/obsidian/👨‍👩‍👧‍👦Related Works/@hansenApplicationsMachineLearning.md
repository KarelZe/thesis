“The correct assignment of trades as buyer-initiated or seller-initiated is paramount in many quantitative finance studies. Simple decision rule methods have been used for signing trades since many data sets available to researchers do not include the sign of each trade executed.” (Hansen, p. 5)

“Rosenthal moved from the simplicity of decision rules to a statistical modeling approach, employing logistic regression to predict trade sign ” (Hansen, p. 18)

“Rosenthal’s model encoded prices and quotes into original and once-lagged metrics for use as predictors, and was influential in inspiring our feature engineering.” (Hansen, p. 18)

“As detailed by Rosenthal, a modest improvement in trade signing accuracy, even just one or two percent, would affect estimates of price impact and could potentially results in savings of hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a year for a large bank .” (Hansen, p. 19)

“Drawing from the work of LR, EMO, and CLNV, we also examine the position of trades’ prices relative to quotes.” (Hansen, p. 46)
