1. Broader term is **trade site classification** = assign the side to a to a transaction and differentiate between buyer- and seller-initiated transactions
- There is no single definition / understanding for the one who initiates trades. [[@olbrysEvaluatingTradeSide2018]] distinguish / discuss immediacy and initiator


# Rule-Based Approaches
## Basic Rules
### Tick Rule-Based Approach
### Quote-Based Approach
## Extended Rules

^ce4ff0

- What are common extensions? How do new algorithms extend the classical ones? What is the intuition? How do they perform? How do the extensions relate? Why do they fail? In which cases do they fail?
- [[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]]
- [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]]
- Which do I want to cover? What are their theoretical properties
- What are common observations or reasons why authors suggested extensions? How do they integrate to the previous approaches? Could this be visualised for a streamlined overview / discussion. 
- What do we find, if we compare the rules 
### Lee and Ready Algorithm
### Ellis-Michaely-Oâ€™Hara Rule
### Reverse Tick Rule 
### Trade Size Rule
# Supervised Approaches
- Introduce a classifcation that differentiates between supervised, unsupervised, reenforcement learning and semi-supervised learning. 
- Introduce the concept of classification as a variant of supervised learning. 
- Could be supervised if all labels are known
- Could be semi-supervised if only some of the labels are known. Cover later.
- Use probabilistic classifier to allow for more in-depth analysis.
- Search for paper that performed a comparsion between Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Net on large set of data sets....

## Selection of Approaches
- What works in similar use cases? What are similar use cases?
- Establish criteria for choosing an architecture:
	- **performance** That is, approach must deliver state-of-the-art performance in similar problems.
	- **interpretability** Classical approaches are transparent in a sense that we know how the decision was derived. In the best case try to aim for local and global interpretability. Think about how interpretability can be narrowed down? Note supervisor wants to see if her features are also important to the model. 
	- Perform a model discussion on results from similar domains.
	- Perform a wide (ensemble) vs. deep (neural net) comparison. 
	- Show that there is a general concensus, that gradient boosted trees and neural networks work best. Show that there is a great bandwith of opinions and its most promising to try both. Papers: [[@shwartz-zivTabularDataDeep2021]] 
	- Choose neural network architectures, that are tailored towards tabular data.
## Gradient Boosted Trees
- start with "wide" architectures.
### Decision Tree

^5db625

- commonly use decision trees as weak lernrs
- Compare how CatBoost, LightGBM and xgboost are different
- Variants of GBM, comparison: [CatBoost vs. LightGBM vs. XGBoost | by Kay Jan Wong | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/catboost-vs-lightgbm-vs-xgboost-c80f40662924) (e. g., symmetric, balanced trees vs. asymetric trees) or see kaggle book for differences between lightgbm, catboost etc. [[@banachewiczKaggleBookData2022]]
- Round off chapter
### Gradient Boosting Procedure
- Motivation for gradient boosted trees
- Introduce notion of tree-based ensemble. Why are sequentially built trees better than parallel ensembles?
- Start of with gradient boosted trees for regression. Gradient boosted trees for classification are derived from that principle.
- cover desirable properties of gradient boosted trees
### Adaptions for Classification
- Explain how the Gradient Boosting Procedure for the regression case, can be extended to the classifcation case
## Transformer Networks
- Go "deep" instead of wide
- Explain how neural networks can be adjusted to perform binary classification.
- use feed-forward networks to discuss central concepts like loss function, back propagation etc.
- Discuss why plain vanilla feed-forward networks are not suitable for tabular data. Why do the perform poorly?
- How does the chosen layer and loss function to problem framing
- How are neural networks optimized?
- Motivation for Transformers
### Network Architecture
### Attention
- cover dot-product attention and sequential attention
- multi-headed attention
- self-attention
### Positional Encoding
### Embeddings
### Extensions in TabNet
- See paper [[@arikTabNetAttentiveInterpretable2020]]
- cover only transformer for tabular data. Explain why.
- Are there other architectures, that I do not cover? Why is this the case?
- TabNet uses neural networks to mimic decision trees by placing importance on only a few features at each layer. The attention layers in that model replace the dot-product self-attention with a type of sparse layer that allows only certain features to pass through.
- Draw on chapter decision trees [[#^5db625]]
- Visualize decision tree-like behaviour

### Extensions in TabTransformer
- See paper [[@huangTabTransformerTabularData2020]] 
- TabTransformer can't capture correlations between categorical and continous features. See [[@somepalliSAINTImprovedNeural2021]]
- Investigate whether my dataset even profits from this type of architecture?
# Semi-Supervised Approaches

^c77130

- Instead of covering all possible semi-supervised approaches, do it the other way around. Take all the approaches from the supervised chapter and show how they can be extended to the semi-supervised setting. This will result in a shorter, yet more streamlined thesis, as results of supervised and semi-supervised learning can be directly compared. 
- Motivation for semi-supervised learning
- Differentiate semi-supervised learning into its subtypes transductive and inductive learning.
- Insert a graphics. Use it as a guidance through the thesis.
- Explain the limitations of transductive learning.
- General we observe performance improvements
- Labelling of data is costly, sometimes impossible (my case).
## Extensions to Gradient Boosted Trees
- Introduce the notion of probilistic classifiers
- Possible extension could be [[@yarowskyUnsupervisedWordSense1995]]. See also Sklearn Self-Training Classifier.
- Discuss why probabilities of gradient boosted trees might be missleading [[@arikTabNetAttentiveInterpretable2020]]
- Problems of tree-based approaches and neural networks in semi-supervised learning. See [[@huangTabTransformerTabularData2020]] or [[@arikTabNetAttentiveInterpretable2020]]and [[@tanhaSemisupervisedSelftrainingDecision2017]]

def seed_everything(seed, tensorflow_init=True, pytorch_init=True): 
"""

random.seed(seed) 
os.environ["PYTHONHASHSEED"] = str(seed) np.random.seed(seed)

```

## Data and Data Preparation
### CBOE Data Set
- data comes at a daily frequency

### ISE Data Set
- data comes at a daily frequency
- Describe interesting properties of the data set. How are values distributed?
- What preprocessing have been applied. See [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]]
- Data range from May 2, 2005 to May 31, 2017 + (new samples)

### Generation of True Labels
- To evaluate the performance of trade classification algoriths the true side of the trade needs to be known. To match LiveVol data, the total customer sell volume or total or total customer buy volume has to match with the transactions in LiveVol. Use unique key of trade date, expiration date, strike price, option type, and root symbol to match the samples. (see [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]]) Notice, that this leads to an imperfect reconstruction!
- Discuss that only a portion of data can be reconstructed. Previous works neglected the unlabeled part. 
- Discuss how previously unused data could be used. This maps to the notion of supervised and semi-supervised learning
- Pseudo Labeling?

### Feature Engineering
- Previously not done due to use of simple rules only. 
- Try different encondings e. g., of the spread.
- Which architectures require what preprocessing? Derive?
- Perform search?
- Standardization is necessary for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of features, such as neural net. [[@banachewiczKaggleBookData2022]]
- Use simple method to impute missing data like mean. We seldomly require more sophisticated methods. [[@banachewiczKaggleBookData2022]]
- Look which of the models can handle missing data inherently. How would TabNet or TabTransformer do it?
- Can some of the features be economically motivated?
- Apply feature transformations that are economically motivated.
- It might be wise to limit the transformations to ones that are present in the classical rules. Would help with reasoning.
### Train-Test Split

^d50f5d

- discuss how split is chosen? Try to align with other works.
- Discuss / visualize how training, validation and test set compare.
- compare distributions of data as part of the data analysis?
- Use a stratified train-test-split to maintain the distribution of the target variable.
- use $k$ fold cross validation if possible (see motivation in e. g. [[@banachewiczKaggleBookData2022]] or [[@batesCrossvalidationWhatDoes2022]])
- A nice way to visualize that the models do not overfit is to show how much errors vary across the test folds.
- Plot learning curves to estimate whether performance will increase with the number of samples. Use it to motivate semi-supervised learning.  [Plotting Learning Curves â€” scikit-learn 1.1.2 documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html) and [Tutorial: Learning Curves for Machine Learning in Python for Data Science (dataquest.io)](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learning-curves-machine-learning/)

## Training and Tuning
### Training of Supervised Models
- Interesting notebook about TabNet [Introduction to TabNet - Kfold 10 [TRAINING] | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ludovick/introduction-to-tabnet-kfold-10-training/notebook)
### Training of Semi-Supervised Models
- Justify training of semi-supervised model from theoretical perspective with findings in chapter [[#^c77130]] . 
- Use learning curves from [[#^d50f5d]].

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- See e. g., [[@olbrysEvaluatingTradeSide2018]][[@owenHyperparameterTuningPython2022]] for ideas / most adequate application.
- What optimizer is chosen? Why? Could try out Adam or Adan?
- Start with something simple like GridSearch. Implement in Optuna, so that one can easily switch between grid search, randomized search, Bayesian search etc. [09_Hyperparameter-Tuning-via-Optuna.ipynb - Colaboratory (google.com)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PacktPublishing/Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Python/blob/main/09_Hyperparameter-Tuning-via-Optuna.ipynb#scrollTo=580226e9-cc08-4dc7-846b-914876343071) 
- Perform comparsion between different samplers to study how sampler effects parameter search. e. g. see best estimate after $n$ trials.
- Also possible to optimize for multiple objectives e. g., accuracy and ... [optuna.visualization.plot_pareto_front â€” Optuna 3.0.2 documentation](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/visualization/generated/optuna.visualization.plot_pareto_front.html)
- See reasoning towards Bayesian search in my last paper. (see e. g., [[@shahriariTakingHumanOut2016]]) 
- For implementations on tab transformer, tabnet and tabmlp see: pytorch wide-deep package.
- for most important hyperparams in litegbm, catboost etc. (see [[@banachewiczKaggleBookData2022]])
- Visualize training and validation curves (seimilar to [3.4. Validation curves: plotting scores to evaluate models â€” scikit-learn 1.1.2 documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/learning_curve.html))

## Evaluation
### Feature Importance Measure
- Feature Importance of Gradient Boosted Trees
- Feature Importance of TabNet
	- allows to obtain both local / and global importance
- Feature Importance of TabTransformer
- Unified Approach for Feature Importance
	- Make feature importances comparable across models.
	- For simple methods see permutation importance, ice and coutnerfactuals (see [8.5 Permutation Feature Importance | Interpretable Machine Learning (christophm.github.io)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/feature-importance.html))
	- Open question: How are correlations handled in SHAP?
	- Think about using kernel-shap. Could work. See e. g., [Feature importance in deep learning - Deep Learning - Deep Learning Course Forums (fast.ai)](https://forums.fast.ai/t/feature-importance-in-deep-learning/42026/91?page=4) and [Census income classification with Keras â€” SHAP latest documentation](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tabular_examples/neural_networks/Census%20income%20classification%20with%20Keras.html)
	- If SHAP is to complex, one could just zero-out features like in [[@guEmpiricalAssetPricing2020]], but be aware of drawbacks. Yet similar method is to randomly permutate features "within a column" and see how to prediction changes" (see [[@banachewiczKaggleBookData2022]]) also comes at the advantage that no retraining is needed, but artificially breaks correlations etc. (see my previous seminar paper).
### Evaluation Metric
- Discuss what metrics are reasonable e. g., why is it reasonable to use the accuracy here? Dataset is likely balanced with a 50-50 distribution, metrics like accuracy are fine for this use case.
- Define the metrics.
- Accuracy, ROC-curve, area under the curve. Think about statistical Tests e. g., $\chi^2$-Test
