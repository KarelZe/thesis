# Empirical Study
1. Data and Data Prepration
		1. Data Set
			- Describe interesting properties of the data set. How are values distributed?
			- What preprocessing have been applied. See [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]]
		2. Feature Engineering
			- Previously not done due to use of simple rules only. 
			- Try different encondings e. g., of the spread.
		3. Train-Test Split
	2. Model Selection and Evaluation
		1. Hyperparameter Tuning
			- See e. g., [[@owenHyperparameterTuningPython2022]] for ideas / most adequate application.
	3. Evaluation Criteria
		1. Metrics
		2. Statistical Tests e. g., $\chi^2$-Test

# Results
