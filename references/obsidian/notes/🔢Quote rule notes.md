- The quote rule classifies a trade as buyer initiated if the trade price is above the midpoint of the buy and ask as buys and if it is below as seller-iniated. Can not classify at the midpoint of the quoted spread. (see e.g., [[@leeInferringTradeDirection1991]] or [[@finucaneDirectTestMethods2000]])
- See [[@hasbrouckTradesQuotesInventories1988]] . Might be one of the first to mention the quote rule. It is however not very clearly defined. Paper also discusses some (handwavy) approaches to treat midpoint transactions.
