es it mean? Point out limitations and e. g., managerial implications or future impact.
- How do wide models compare to deep models
- Study sources of missclassification. See e. g., [[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]]
- Would assembeling help here? As discussed in [[@huangSnapshotEnsemblesTrain2017]] ensembles can only improve the model, if individual models have a low test error and if models do not overlap in the samples they missclassify.
- The extent to which inaccurate trade classification biases empirical research dependes on whether misclassifications occur randomly or systematically [[@theissenTestAccuracyLee2000]]. This document also contains ideas how to study the impact of wrong classifications in stock markets. Might different in option markets.
- Ceveat is that we don't know the true labels, but rather subsets. Could be biased?

“The established methods, most notably the algorithms of Lee and Ready (1991) (LR), Ellis et al. (2000) (EMO), and Chakrabarty et al. (2007) (CLNV), classify trades based on the proximity of the transaction price to the quotes in effect at the time of the trade. This is problematic due to the increased frequency of order submission and cancellation. With several quote changes taking place at the time of the trade, it is not clear which quotes to select for the decision rule of the algorithm.” (Jurkatis, 2022, p. 6)
