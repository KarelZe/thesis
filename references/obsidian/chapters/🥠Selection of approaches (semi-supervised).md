- Start with what the ultimate goal of semi-supervised classification is? See [[@chapelleSemiSupervisedClassificationLow2005]] for catchy introduction. -> We want to find a decision boundary that lies in a low-density region / want to create models that generalize. -> Obtain models that generalize. -> In ultimate consequence avoid overfitting of the model.
- Instead of covering all possible semi-supervised approaches, do it the other way around. Take all the approaches from the supervised chapter and show how they can be extended to the semi-supervised setting. This will result in a shorter, yet more streamlined thesis, as results of supervised and semi-supervised learning can be directly compared. 
- Motivation for semi-supervised learning
- Differentiate semi-supervised learning into its subtypes transductive and inductive learning.
- Insert a graphics. Use it as a guidance through the thesis.
- Explain the limitations of transductive learning.
- General we observe performance improvements
- Labelling of data is costly, sometimes impossible (my case).
- For overview see [[@zhuSemiSupervisedLearningLiterature]]
- for problems / success of semi-supervised learning in tabular data see [[@yoonVIMEExtendingSuccess2020]]
- **pseudo-labelling:** e. g., [How To Build an Efficient NLP Model â€“ Weights & Biases (wandb.ai)](https://wandb.ai/darek/fbck/reports/How-To-Build-an-Efficient-NLP-Model--VmlldzoyNTE5MDEx) and [[@leePseudolabelSimpleEfficient]]. Requires solving the issue of obtaining soft probablities. Reason why pseudo-labels are a poor idea -> requires change in neural network architecture -> we aim for comparability.
- For pretraining ofneural net architectures also see argumentation in [[ðŸ§ Deep Learning Methods/Transformer/@somepalliSAINTImprovedNeural2021]]
- See also [[@bahriSCARFSelfSupervisedContrastive2022]], while the paper is not 100 % relevant, it contains interesting citations.
- How does regularization relate to semi-supervised learning? Don't both aim for the same objective?
- [[@huangTabTransformerTabularData2020]] compare in their semi-supervised comparsion against GBM (PL) GBMs trained on pseudo labelled data
