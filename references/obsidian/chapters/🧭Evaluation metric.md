- Discuss what metrics are reasonable e. g., why is it reasonable to use the accuracy here? Dataset is likely balanced with a 50-50 distribution, metrics like accuracy are fine for this use case.
- Define the metrics.
- Accuracy, ROC-curve, area under the curve. Think about statistical Tests e. g., $\chi^2$-Test
- Introduce concept of a confusion matrix. Are all errors equally problematic?


We optimize for the accuracy
