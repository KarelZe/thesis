**Trade classification on option data sets** ðŸ’¸

While classical trade classification algorithms are extensively tested in the stock markets (e. g., Chakrabarty et al., 2012; Odders-White, 2000), few works have examined trade classification in option markets (Grauer et al., 2022; Savickas and Wilson, 2003). For option markets, the sole focus is on classical classification rules. Even in stock markets, machine learning has hardly been applied to trade classification. An early work of rosenthalModelingTradeDirection2012 incorporates standard trade classification rules into a logistic regression model and achieves outperformance in the stock market. 

**Trade classification using machine learning** ðŸ“Š
Similarly, [[@fedeniaMachineLearningCorporate2021]] and [[@ronenMachineLearningTrade2022]] improve upon classical rules with a random forest, a tree-based ensemble. Albeit their work considers a broad range of approaches, the selection leaves the latest advancements in artificial neural networks and ensemble learning aside. Even if the focus is on standard techniques, the unclear research agenda with regards to model selection, tuning, and testing hampers the transferability of their results to the yet unstudied option market.
