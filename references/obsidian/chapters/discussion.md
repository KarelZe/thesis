es it mean? Point out limitations and e. g., managerial implications or future impact.
- How do wide models compare to deep models
- Study sources of missclassification. See e. g., [[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]]
- Would assembeling help here? As discussed in [[@huangSnapshotEnsemblesTrain2017]] ensembles can only improve the model, if individual models have a low test error and if models do not overlap in the samples they missclassify.
- The extent to which inaccurate trade classification biases empirical research dependes on whether misclassifications occur randomly or systematically [[@theissenTestAccuracyLee2000]]. This document also contains ideas how to study the impact of wrong classifications in stock markets. Might different in option markets.
- Ceveat is that we don't know the true labels, but rather subsets. Could be biased?
