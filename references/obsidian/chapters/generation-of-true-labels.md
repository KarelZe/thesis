- To evaluate the performance of trade classification algoriths the true side of the trade needs to be known. To match LiveVol data, the total customer sell volume or total or total customer buy volume has to match with the transactions in LiveVol. Use unique key of trade date, expiration date, strike price, option type, and root symbol to match the samples. (see [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]]) Notice, that this leads to an imperfect reconstruction!
- The approach of [[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]] matches the LiveVol data set, only if there is a matching volume on buyer or seller side. Results in 40 % reconstruction rate
- **fuzzy matching:** e. g., match volumes, even if there are small deviations in the volumes e. g. 5 contracts. Similar technique used for time stamps in [[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]]. Why might this be a bad idea?
- Discuss that only a portion of data can be reconstructed. Previous works neglected the unlabeled part. 
- Discuss how previously unused data could be used. This maps to the notion of supervised and semi-supervised learning
- Pseudo Labeling?
- We assign sells the label `0` and buys the label `1`. This has the advantage that the calculation from the logloss doesn't require any mapping. Easy interpretation as probability.
