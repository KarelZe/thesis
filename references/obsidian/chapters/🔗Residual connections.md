Before studying transformers for tabular data, we revisit *residual connections* and *layer norm* in the transformer block and discuss alternatives for their arrangement. What seems like a pedantic detail, is vital for the training process and convergence of the network, as we show.

Recall from our introduction on transformers (see Chapter [[ðŸ¤–Transformer]]), that both the encoder and decoder stack multiple transformer blocks, each of which consists off several sub-layers, resulting in a deep networks. As neural networks are commonly trained using back-propagation, which relies on the gradient for the error (with respect to the parameters) to be propagated through the network starting at the last layer, vanishing or exploding gradient pose a major difficulty in training deep neural networks (see e. g. [[@heDeepResidualLearning2015]]).

Thus, stacking multiple layers in the encoder or decoder prevents the gradient information to flow less efficiently through the network, and may affect the overall training performance ([[@wangLearningDeepTransformer2019]] ;  p. 1,811).  As a remedy, [[@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2017]] (p. 3) add residual connections around each sub-layer:

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">(Formula, similar to Wang et al)
for a solution. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sub-layer in encoder or decoder, and $\theta_l$ be the parameters of the sub-layer. A residual unit is defined to be (He et al., 2016b):
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{l+1} & =f\left(y_l\right) \\
y_l & =x_l+\mathcal{F}\left(x_l ; \theta_l\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $x_l$ and $x_{l+1}$ are the input and output of the $l$-th sub-layer, and $y_l$ is the intermediate output followed by the post-processing function $f(\cdot)$. In this way, $x_l$ is explicitly exposed to $y_l$ (see Eq. (2)).</mark>

Intuitively, the residual connection provides an alternative path for information to flow through the network, since some information can bypass the sub-layer and is added to its output. Also, exploding or vanishing gradients are mitigated, as gradients can bypass the sub-layer, contribution towards an easier optimization ([[@liuRethinkingSkipConnection2020]]).  Residual connections also help to preserve the positional embeddings (see chapter [[ðŸ§µPositional Embedding]]), as the layer's inputs are maintained in the identity mapping.
