## Notes Sebastian Raschka
-   A survey paper that investigates and compares deep neural networks proposed for tabular datasets.
-   The paper is accompanied by benchmark code, and since the paper doesÂ _not_Â propose a new method for tabular data, the results may be more objective than others.
-   Based on the results, gradient-boosted tree ensembles still mostly outperform deep learning methods on tabular datasets.
