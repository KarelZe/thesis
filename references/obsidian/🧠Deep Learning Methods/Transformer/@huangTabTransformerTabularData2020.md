“The state-of-the-art for modeling tabular data is treebased ensemble methods such as the gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT)” (Huang et al., 2020, p. 1)

“The tree-based ensemble models can achieve competitive prediction accuracy, are fast to train and easy to interpret. These benefits make them highly favourable among machine learning practitioners. However, the tree-based models have several limitations in comparison to deep learning models. (a) They are not suitable for continual training from streaming data, and do not allow efficient end-to-end learning of image/text encoders in presence of multi-modality along with tabular data. (b) In their basic form they are not suitable for state-of-the-art. semi-supervised learning methods.” (Huang et al., 2020, p. 1)
