## Resasons for domination of ensemble of decision trees for tabular data
“First, because DT-based approaches have certain benefits: (i) they are representionally efficient for decision manifolds with approximately hyperplane boundaries which are common in tabular data; and (ii) they are highly interpretable in their basic form (e.g. by tracking decision nodes) and there are popular post-hoc explainability methods for their ensemble form, e.g. (Lundberg, Erion, and Lee 2018) – this is an important concern in many real-world applications; (iii) they are fast to train. Second, because previously-proposed DNN architectures are not well-suited for tabular data: e.g. stacked convolutional layers or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are vastly overparametrized – the lack of appropriate inductive bias often causes them to fail to find optimal solutions for tabular decision manifolds (Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville 2016; Shavitt and Segal 2018; Xu et al. 2019).” (Arik and Pfister, 2020, p. 1)
