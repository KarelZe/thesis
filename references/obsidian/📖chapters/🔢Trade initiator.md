In absence of a universal definition of the trade initiator, the following definitions are frequently found in research. ([[@odders-whiteOccurrenceConsequencesInaccurate2000]] 267) adapts a chronological view based on the order arrival. She defines the trade initiator as the party (buyer or seller) who places their order last, chronologically. This definition requires knowledge about the order submission times. In contrast, ([[@leeInferringInvestorBehavior2000]]94--97) put forth a definition based on the party in demand for immediate execution. (...)  This definition remains ambiguous for trades that result from crossed limit orders, matched market orders, or batched orders ([[@leeInferringInvestorBehavior2000]]94--95). Independent from the order type and submission time, ([[@ellisAccuracyTradeClassification2000]]533) define the trade initiator from the position of the customer. (...)

The applicability 

Consequently, we denote it by $y \in \{0,1\}$, whereby $y=0$ indicates a trade that was initiated by a seller and $y=1$ by a buyer. As the trade initiator is commonly not provided with the option data sets, it must be inferred using trade classification algorithms ([[@easleyOptionVolumeStock1998]] 453). We use $\hat{y}$ to distinguish the predicted from the observed trade initiator.

The following section introduces basic rules for option trade classification. We start with the classical quote and tick rule and continue with the more recent depth and trade size rule. Our focus is on classification rules, that sign trades on a trade-by-trade basis. Consequently, we exclude algorithms for aggregated trades, like the BVC algorithm of ([[@easleyFlowToxicityLiquidity2012]]1466--1468).
