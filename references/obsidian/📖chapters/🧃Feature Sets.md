- option series (an option series is characterized by option type (call/put), underlying stock, strike price, and maturity date),

## NBBO / EX
- “The structure of the U.S. options market is similar to that of the equity market but has some distinct features. Options are typically cross-listed across multiple fully electronic exchanges, and the NBBO rule is enforced. Investors can post limit or market orders, and market-makers are obliged to provide continuous two-sided quotes.” (Chordia et al., 2021, p. 3)
- “lthough a number of markets satisfy these assumptions, the equity options market fits them particularly well. First, in early 2003, prior to the start of my sample period, all options exchanges were connected through Linkage and the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) rule was introduced. At the same time, investors gained access to real-time information about the best prices from all exchanges.” (Muravyev, 2016, p. 685)
- “Second, market-makers stand on the liquidity-providing side of most trades. In the options market, market-makers transfer liquidity not only over time but also across different options. With several hundred option contracts available for each underlying, two investors rarely select the same option and thus they are likely to trade with a market-maker. Also, exchange rules grant lead market-makers substantial competitive edge over other liquidity providers (e.g., the 60/40 NBBO order split rule). These rules further strengthen lead market-makers’ position as the main liquidity providers and make it hard for new players to enter” (Muravyev, 2016, p. 685)
- “Condition (d) also serves another purpose. Since the trade price is equal to the NBBO price quoted by at least two exchanges, this condition resolves ambiguity about trade direction as further discussed in the Internet Appendix.” (Muravyev, 2016, p. 689) There seems to be some amiguouty I do not understnad yet.

## trade size
- “Trade size affects classification precision in two related ways. First, as found by EMO (2000), small trades are more likely to be executed at the quotes, implying an inverse relation between classification precision and trade size. Second, large reversed-quote limit orders are more likely to be executed by the market maker in his hedging and portfolio rebalancing activity, resulting in marketmaker-initiated trades” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 888)
- “Thus, large trades are more informative than medium and small trades, suggesting that option investors no longer engage in “stealth trading,” whereby informed investors split their option trades and medium-sized trades are the most informed (Anand and Chakravarty (2007)). Fourth, the underlying stock price responds to option trades instantly, and the price impact of option trades on the underlying stock price is permanent and increasing in trade size. Option trades are thus informative about the underlying stock price level.” ([[@muravyevOrderFlowExpected2016]], p. 676)
- “There is little need for stealth trading in the options market today, however, since order flow is sparse and is spread across multiple contracts, making it hard for informed traders to hide by splitting orders into mid-sized pieces. A possible explanation is that Anand and Chakravarty (2007) use data from 1999, when options were traded manually on the floor with no linkage between exchanges.” ([[@muravyevTherePriceDiscovery2013]], p. 693)
- informed trading: “From the above analysis, we find evidence of trade size fragmentation, but we are unable to say anything about when either medium or small size trades would be preferred by informed traders. This brings us to the second objective of this study, wherein we investigate the relation (if any) between price discovery attributable to distinct trade size classes and the role of option volume, money10We thank the referee for suggesting this comparison” ([[@anandStealthTradingOptions2007]], p. 177)
- “If these informed traders attempt to hide their information by splitting their trades into medium size trades, we should see medium size trades associated with higher price discovery in the dominant exchange and not in the other (non-dominant) exchanges. Underpinning our analysis is the intuition that an informed trader is likely to choose the options market venue (and option trade size) that best protects her ability to hide.” (Anand and Chakravarty, 2007, p. 183)
- “The information share of medium size trades on the dominant exchange is consistently statistically higher than the information share of medium size trades on other exchanges collectively. In sum, the evidence presented in the current section shows that informed traders do in fact look for volume in the options of the firm of interest and then fragment their trades in that exchange.” (Anand and Chakravarty, 2007, p. 184)
- “For liquid contracts (i.e., higher option volume), the largest contribution to price discovery comes from medium size trades while for relatively illiquid contracts the largest fraction of price discovery is associated with small size trades.” (Anand and Chakravarty, 2007, p. 186) -> is there difference between volume of option series?
- “We also show that the strategic fragmentation of trades by informed traders, and the price discovery that follows such actions, is a function of the volume of the options contract: the moneyness and the time-to-maturity of the options do not appear to play a major role after controlling for liquidity. The implication is that informed traders act strategically in fragmenting their orders depending on the liquidity in the contract that affects their ability to hide.” (Anand and Chakravarty, 2007, p. 186)

## Option series
- “Finally, we analyze informed traders’ choice of option series for each of the 20 stocks in our data with the highest option volume traded on them. Our analysis is motivated by the desire to understand which of the several option series traded on a stock are preferred by informed traders. We find that the largest information share is exhibited by at-the-money calls. Puts do not appear to contribute significantly to the price discovery process except in those days when the underlying stocks go down significantly in price, but even then their relative information share is superseded by at-the-money calls. Our findings imply that informed traders prefer at-the-money calls to execute their option trades.” ([[@anandStealthTradingOptions2007]], p. 186)

## strike price
“The underlying price change is a critical factor that can either reduce classification precision by making past prices and quotes obsolete, or enhance it by 7Using the underlying price at the time of the last trade may be more appropriate for the tick rule. Similarly, for the EMO method, one might use the underlying price at the time of the latest quote for at-the-quote trades, and the underlying price at the time of the latest trade for all other trades. However, such differential treatment would hinder cross-rule comparisons. Therefore, we use the same variable for all four method rdecreasing the probability of RQ trades (i.e., buys at the bid and sells at the ask). Specifically, the underlying price increase since the most recent call option quote will result in an increase in the option’s value relative to the quote, leading to the increase in market orders to buy that call at the ask. Therefore, limit orders to buy at the bid will remain unexecuted, thus reducing the probability of RQ trades.8 The greater the drift in the underlying price since the last quotes, the stronger the effect. Similar reasoning applies to underlying price decreases and to puts.” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 889)

## issue type
- “Time to maturity also has an indirect effect on classification precision. Trades in options with longer maturity tend to be smaller, resulting in negative correlation between the effects of maturity and of trade size. Because an option’s delta is non-monotonic in maturity, we do not expect a strong correlation between the effects of maturity and underlying price change. Finally, RAES buys (sells) are automatically crossed with the market maker’s ask (bid) prices and we would expect precise quote-based classifications of these trades” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 889)
- “In a closely related and important paper, Chen et al. (2018) show that high buying activity in deep out-ofthe-money S&P 500 index put options predicts low monthly market excess returns.” (Chordia et al., 2021, p. 2)
- “The market of DOTM SPX put options are well-suited for this purpose. First, this market is large in terms of the economic exposures it provides for aggregate tail risks.3 Second, compared to other over-the-counter derivatives that also provide exposures to aggregate tail risks, the exchange-traded SPX options have the advantages of better liquidity and almost no counterparty risk (other than exchange failure).” ([[@chenDemandCrashInsurance2019]], p. 5)
- “Using data on the trading activities between public investors and financial intermediaries in the market of deep out-of-the-money put options on the S&P 500 index (abbreviated as DOTM SPX puts), we exploit the price-quantity relations to identify periods when shocks to intermediary constraints are likely to be the main driver of the variations in the net amount of trading between public investors and financial intermediaries.” (Chen et al., 2019, p. 1)
- “To construct the constraint measure, we start by computing the net amount of DOTM SPX puts that public investors in aggregate purchase each month (henceforth referred to as P N BO), which also reflects the net amount of the same options that broker-dealers and market-makers sell in that month. While it is well known that financial intermediaries are net sellers of these types of options during normal times, we find that P N BO varies significantly over time and tends to fall/turn negative during times of market distress.” (Chen et al., 2019, p. 1)
- “In contrast to Pan and Poteshman (2006), we use a unique data set from the International Securities Exchange (ISE), which contains the complete daily record of buy and sell activity in index options over a 12-year period, together with details on whether a transaction is involved in opening or closing an options position. These options are actively traded; indeed, on the ISE, the notional volume in index options is about onefifth of the total notional volume in all individual stock options during our sample period.” (Chordia et al., 2021, p. 1) -> index options are highly liquid / frequently traded.
- “Further, an upward movement in bid and ask quotes, which implies that informed market makers encourage sells because they have positive information, is not accompanied by higher put returns.” (Chordia et al., 2021, p. 2)
- “Market makers offer this insurance by selling index puts. In times of market stress, the demand for insurance increases. The expected market risk premium increases as well, leading to a positive relation between public put buying and subsequent market excess returns. On the other hand, in good times, people sell puts in the hope of earning the put premium. This hypothesis is consistent with Grossman and Zhou (1996)andBates(2008). In their models, less crash-averse agents (the intermediary firms making markets) insure the more crash-averse agents (outside investors) through options.” (Chordia et al., 2021, p. 17)
- “Institutional investors prefer SPX options because of the ability to execute large multileg trades and relatively low transaction costs. Other index options, including the most liquid ISE index options that we study, are traded by few investors with high preference for a given index and mostly by unsophisticated retail investors. First, using intraday options transaction data from OPRA from 2006 to 2015, we find that the average dollar trade size for index options on the ISE is one-sixth of that for SPX options. Second, we note thattheopen-closedatalabeltradingvolumeas “firm” when a member like Morgan Stanley trades for their own account, while other non-market-maker trades that include retail trades are marked as “customer.” Thus, firm volume comes entirely from sophisticated institutions, while retail investor trades are part of customer volume. For position-opening trades, we compute the fraction of total volume that corresponds to customer volume. Consistent with the hypothesis that most order flow in ISE index options is retail, customer trades constitute about 90% of position-opening volume for ISE index options, which is substantially larger than the corresponding fraction for CBOE (69%).” (Chordia et al., 2021, p. 17)
- “Our results are most consistent with the notion that investors buy protection using put options when uncertainty is high. The uncertainty is accompanied by higher required market returns, thus yielding our predictability result. This is supported by the finding that the predictability is strongest around periods with scheduled macroeconomic news announcements (when uncertainty is high). Further, put option bid–ask spreads are lower, whereas the call option spreads are the same, in weeks with major macroeconomic announcements as compared with weeks without the major macroeconomic announcements, suggesting that increased put demand during periods of high uncertainty adds to liquidity in put options markets.” (Chordia et al., 2021, p. 18)

## time-to-maturity

“Expiration dummies are particularly good instruments. Investors substitute expiring option positions with similar nonexpiring ones in the three-day window around the expiration day (every third Friday of a month). Because investors are short call and put equity options on average, the rollover creates unprecedentedly large selling pressure in the nonexpiring options. Option expirations create exogenous variation in order imbalance, and thus exogenous variation in market-maker inventories as investors open new positions to replace positions in expiring options. Volatility and returns of the underlying stocks change little around expiration. Thus, fundamentals and informed trading are not responsible for the order imbalance.” (Muravyev, 2016, p. 700)

## moneyness
- Comparing options with different maturities and moneyness, we find that our trade size rule achieves the highest improvements when applied to options with long maturities and deep-out-ofthe money options ([[@grauerOptionTradeClassification2022]])
- “he moneyness ratio for call options is calculated as the underlying 6In results not reported here, we find that daily trading volume has trivial economic impact on misclassification probability for all four rules. divided by the strike price. The moneyness ratio for puts is the strike price divided by the underlying price. The absolute value of the relative change in the underlying price is computed as abs Pc Pp Pp,wherePc is the underlying price at the time of the current transaction (i.e., the transaction being classified), and Pp is the underlying price at the time of the latest quote” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 888)
option type
- “Option moneyness has two indirect effects on classification precision. First, deep in-the-money options have deltas close to one (in absolute value) and, therefore, are more sensitive to the underlying asset price changes. Second, there is a positive relation between option moneyness and trade size” (Savickas and Wilson, 2003, p. 889)
- “For example, out-of-the-money options provide the highest leverage, which attracts informed investors.” (Muravyev, 2016, p. 676)
- “Out-of-the-money options offer the highest leverage (exposure for a dollar invested) and thus are particularly attractive for informed investors. Consistent with this argument, the information price impact is decreasing and convex in absolute delta. Figure 3(D) shows that the impact decreases from 0.4% for out-of-the-money options to 0.15% for in-the-money options. Next, private information is often short-lived and is related to near-term events, and thus short-term options are better suited for informed investors in addition to providing higher leverage. Indeed, the price impact decreases by 0.12% if time-to-expiration decreases from 80 days to 20 days. Buyer-initiated trades have a higher price impact than sell trades, because these trades provide an opportunity to bet not only on future volatility but also on the underlying direction. These results are broadly consistent with Pan and Poteshman (2006), except that I do not find a significant difference between call and put options, perhaps because my sample consists of large stocks that are easy to sell short.” (Muravyev, 2016, p. 695)

**Ideas:**
-   While the determination of average trade sizes allows further gauging of common and larger trade sizes, the initial order size must also be considered. In electronic markets, and particularly in options, price guidance is given by quotes. Trade initiators rarely trade at these quoted prices (5-20% of options screen volume), and mostly enter limit orders mid-market. The difference between order and trade sizes is twofold. Firstly, a trade initiator may slice an order into suborders to minimise market impact by trading 500 futures or options via 5 orders at 100 contracts. Trade records provide evidence for this practise as the trade executions feature the same counterparty on the trade at identical prices with subsequent, virtually identical timestamps. Secondly, other market participants respond to incoming orders from trade initiators in a competitive fashion with immediate-or-cancel (IOC) orders. The initial order of 500 contracts placed a tick under the best quoted offer may be traded by, for example, 3 market makers sending IOCs in 100, 100 and 300 contracts. (https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/esma_mifid_add_fese_replyform_1.docx)

In an idealised setting where the noise traders/trade initiators place a market order that executes against a limit order or against posted quotes, we can accurately identify the side that initiated the trade based on whether it was executed at the ask price or the bid price. Although such a setting is not a complete depiction of real world stock markets, the literature typically uses such an algorithm to identify the side that initiates the trade because trade initiators are more likely to place market orders since they are less likely to accept the risk of not consummating their trades. In contrast, market makers are more likely to place limit orders because their primary objective is not to take a position in the stock but to clear the market and to profit from the spread. It is possible that some noise traders/trade initiators may place limit orders rather than market orders with the hope of executing trades at a more favourable price. In such instances, trades would cross between two trade initiators rather than between an active trade initiator and a market maker. Such trades add noise to the measure of order flow but as long as some of the trades are truly between active trade initiators and market makers, the net order flow is still an unbiased measure of net trades initiated for a particular stock. The key point to note here is that market makers are involved in at least some of the trades as liquidity providers, and the hypotheses that we examine do not apply to them. https://abfer.org/media/abfer-events-2013/annual-conference/investment-finance/track3-buyers-versus-sellers-who-initiates-trades-and-when.pdf

“An interesting upshot of these results is that the aggressor side of trading appears little related to any underlying information, a decoupling that we argue arises from how trading transpires in modern high frequency markets. Our findings complement recent work by Collin-Dufresne and Vos (2015) who find that standard measures of adverse selection relying on estimates of the persistent price effect” ([[@easleyDiscerningInformationTrade2016]] p. 270)

- Add frequency of trade and order imbalances as features. Came up with this idea when reading [[@aitkenIntradayAnalysisProbability1995]]
- [[@berkmanLargeOptionTrades1996]]
- Some feature ideas like order imbalance could be adapted from [[@aitkenIntradayAnalysisProbability1995]].
- [[@blazejewskiLocalNonParametricModel2005]] use more previous trades to a $k$-nn search. Not feasible, as my data set only contains the previous trade and it misses rather often already.
- [[@ronenMachineLearningTrade2022]] suggest to use models that can handle time series components. This would limit our choices. Thus we use feature engineering to induce a notion of time into our models.
- “In addition to the location of transaction prices relative to the quotes, we also examine other factors that affect classification accuracy rates. These factors include tick condition, trade size, time between the current trade and the immediate previous trade (trade distance), time between the current trade and the last quote update (quote distance), and the percentage spread. Our results indicate that the probability of correct classification is positively correlated with the percentage spread, trade distance, and quote distance and negatively correlated with trade size” ([[@chakrabartyTradeClassificationAlgorithms2007]] 2007, p. 3808) -> ok, but doesn't really fit here.
- Ratio between trade price and Nbbo:g designated market makers). To investigate these three hypotheses further, we extract the trade and data from the TAQ database for each of the stocks within each packagThis content downloaded from 141.52.248.2 on Sun, 09 Apr 2023 15:08:08 UTC All use subject to ht Kavajecz and Keim 481 each individual stock symbol, we collect all trades and quotes for the nine-day period beginning three days before the auction date and ending five days after the auction date. In preparing the trade and quote data to be used in calculating the variables of interest, we conduct the standard adjustments. First, the national best bid and offer (NBBO) is calculated over the nine-day window for each stock. Second, trades are adjusted using the Lee and Ready (1991) five-second rule and are designated as buyer- or seller-initiated using the Lee and Ready classification scheme. In particular, trades are designated as buyer- (seller-) initiated if the trade price is above (below) the current NBBO midpoint. For trades at the NBBO midpoint, the initiator is determined by whether the last transaction price change was an uptick (buy) or downtick (sell). Using the trade and quote data, we construct three variables that are relevant for Hypotheses 1-3: i) cumulative market-adjusted returns, ii) net dollar trading volume in the direction of the package trade, and iii) a trading efficiency measure. We discuss the construction of each in turn. To construct cumulative market-adjusted returns, we compute daily returns for each stock using end-of-day quote midpoints, then the return of the Russell 2000 value index over the corresponding day is subtracted to obtain a measure of market-adjusted movement for each stock. We use the Russell 2000 value index to match the small-cap value characteristics of the stocks in our sample (which are dictated by the investment style of the asset manager). Having normalised the market-adjusted return of each stock to one the day before the auction, we cumulate the market-adjusted return for six days beginning on the auction day. We construct a weighted average separately for buys and sells and for three categories of size for the package trades, where the weights are the dollar volume of the package trade. The three size groups are: small trades, including trades that make up less than 50% of that stock's average daily dollar volume; medium trades, including trades between 50% and 100% of average daily dollar volume; and large trades, including trades larger than the average dollar volume traded in one day. Our dollar trading volume variable is based on the difference between trad ing volume in the direction of the package trade vs. trading volume against the direction of the package trade. For each half-hour period, we sum separately the buyer- and seller-initiated dollar trading volume associated with each stock in the package. Given the substantial differences in trading volume across stocks in the sample, we normalise the dollar trading volume by dividing the buyer- and seller-initiated dollar trading volume by the average daily dollar trading volume for that stock (measured over the prior 12 months). We then assign a trade direc tion to the volume series associated with each particular trade within the package. Specifically, if a stock is to be purchased (sold) within a package, then the buyer initiated (seller-initiated) volume is designated as volume with the package trade and the seller-initiated (buyer-initiated) volume is designated as volume against the package trade. For both series, volume with and against the package trade, we construct a weighted average (again the weights are the dollar volume of the pack age trade) where stocks are allocated to a category according to the stock's trade size (small, medium, and large). Finally, we cumulate the difference between the volume with the package trade and the volume against the package trade. By cumulating the difference between the volume with and the volume against the This content downloaded from 141.52.248.2 on Sun, 09 Apr 2023 15:08:08 UTC All use subject to ht 482 Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis trade, we have a measure of the net volume in the direction of the package trade for each half-hour period over the window. Our third variable measures where trade prices are executed relative to the NBBO at the time of the trade. For each buyer-initiated trade, we calculate the ratio of the trade price to the existing national best ask quote, while for each seller-initiated trade we calculate the ratio of the existing national best bid quote to the trade price. This ratio, which we refer to as our trading efficiency variable, provides a measure of where the transaction price occurs relative to the corre sponding NBBO quote. Ratio values less than one denote trade prices within the NBBO spread that contain price improvement, while values greater than one de note trade prices outside the NBBO spread that contain price concessions. Like the trading volume variable, we assign a trade direction to the buyer- and seller initiated trading efficiency series based on the direction of the associated trade within the package. This results in a trading efficiency measure with the trade and a trading efficiency measure against the trade. Similar to the net volume variable, we compute a weighted average of the trading efficiency measures separately for the three trade size categories (small, medium, and large).

By cumulating the difference between the volume with and the volume against the This content downloaded from 141.52.248.2 on Sun, 09 Apr 2023 15:08:08 UTC All use subject to ht 482 Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis trade, we have a measure of the net volume in the direction of the package trade for each half-hour period over the window. Our third variable measures where trade prices are executed relative to the NBBO at the time of the trade. For each buyer-initiated trade, we calculate the ratio of the trade price to the existing national best ask quote, while for each seller-initiated trade we calculate the ratio of the existing national best bid quote to the trade price. This ratio, which we refer to as our trading efficiency variable, provides a measure of where the transaction price occurs relative to the corre sponding NBBO quote. Ratio values less than one denote trade prices within the NBBO spread that contain price improvement, while values greater than one de note trade prices outside the NBBO spread that contain price concessions. Like the trading volume variable, we assign a trade direction to the buyer- and seller initiated trading efficiency series based on the direction of the associated trade within the package. This results in a trading efficiency measure with the trade and a trading efficiency measure against the trade. Similar to the net volume variable, we compute a weighted average of the trading efficiency measures separately for the three trade size categories (small, medium, and large).

% TODO: These proxies have in common that they factor in the order book imbalance the relative depth quoted at the best bid and ask prices. If traders care about transaction costs, the relatively wide ask-side spread deters buyers, whereas the tight bid-side spread may attract sellers. There are then more traders submitting market orders at the bid side, and the true effective spread is, on average, smaller than the average midpoint effective spread.

% TODO: Derive in greater detail why orderbook imbalance makes sense! See my notes from Hagströmer
