**scratch pad:**

- understand what log odds
- logistic function
- handling categorical features
- What missing features?

for integration of regularization term see: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07248.pdf

Practical implementations. CatBoost: Symmetric trees (cheap to construct + act as regularizer)
