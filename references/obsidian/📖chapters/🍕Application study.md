“To give the improvement in classification accuracy more economic meaning, I apply the trade classification methods to the estimation of transaction costs. The transaction costs in turn are used in a portfolio optimization exercise. The results show that an investor with a mean-variance utility function would be willing to forgo up to 33 bps on yearly returns to use the proposed algorithm to estimate transaction costs instead of the LR algorithm.” ([[@jurkatisInferringTradeDirections2022]], 2022, p. 7)
