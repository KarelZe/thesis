## Setup
Albeit the classification accuracy is a reasonable measure for comparing classifiers, one cannot immediately infer how changes in accuracy e. g., an improvement by $1{}\%$, affect the application domains. In an attempt to make our results tangible, we apply all algorithms to estimate trading cost, a problem we previously identified to be reliant on correct trade classification (see [[üë∂Introduction]]) and a common testing ground for trade classification rules (cp. [[@ellisAccuracyTradeClassification2000]]541) and ([[@finucaneDirectTestMethods2000]]569) and ([[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]]896--897).


<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">(What is the broader idea?)</mark> A common proxy for trading cost is the *effective spread*, which is the difference between trade price and fundamental value (citation).  The *nominal, effective spread* is given by:
$$
S_{i,t} = 2 (P_{i,t} - V_{i,t}) D_{i,t}
$$
Like before, $i$ indexes the security and $t$ denotes the time. Here, $D_{i,t}$ is the trade direction, which is either $1$ for customer buy orders and $-1$ for customer sell orders. Unless the trade initiator is known, we set $D_{i,t} = y_{i,t}$ and $D_{i,t}=\hat{y}_{it}$, if inferred from a rule or classifier. As the fundamental value is unobserved, it must be approximated by $V_{i,t}$. Frequently, the midpoint of the quoted spread is used (cp. [[@leeMarketIntegrationPrice1993]]1018). It . ([[@hagstromerBiasEffectiveBidask2021]]317) reasons that the appeal of using the midpoint lies in the high data availability, simplicity, and applicability in an online setting. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">(Lee Why does the midpoint make sense from a theoretical perspective?)</mark>. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">What is alternative? Why?</mark> We multiply by $2$ to convert the so-obtained half-spread into the effective spread. 

Readily apparent from (cref-eq), the correctness of the with a trade classification rule or machine learning-based classifier, as it leads to an under- or over-estimated effective spread, and ultimately or trade costs overall.

For convenience, we also calculate the *relative effective spread* as 
$$
{PS}_{i,t} = S_{i,t} / V_{i,t}.
$$
The subsequent section estimates both the nominal and relative effective spread for our test sets.

## Results
The actual and the estimated effective spreads, as well as the quoted spread, are shown in the (cref tab) aggregated by (...). ([[@savickasInferringDirectionOption2003]] 896--897) previously estimated the effective spreads on a subset of rules for option trades at the gls-CBOE, which can be compared against.

A $t$-test is used to test if the estimated, effective spread is significantly different from the mean true effective spread / significantly greater than zero at $p=0.01$ (cp.[[@finucaneDirectTestMethods2000]]570). Alternatively compare correlations $\rho$ and medians using the Wilcoxon test with null hypothesis of the equal medians with $p=0.01$ (cp.[[@theissenTestAccuracyLee2000]]12).
