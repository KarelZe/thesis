**Outline:**
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Cref-[[👪Related Work]] reviews publications on trade classification in option markets and using machine learning, thereby underpinning our research framework. Cref-[[🍪Selection Of Supervised Approaches]] discusses and introduces supervised methods for trade classification. Then, cref- [[🍪Selection Of Semisupervised Approaches]] extends the previously selected algorithms for the semi-supervised case. We test the models in cref-[[🌏Dataset]] in an empirical setting. In cref-[[🍕Application study]]  we apply our models to the problem of effective spread estimation. Finally, cref-[[🧓Discussion]] concludes.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section I, we review
some of the theoretical and empirical literature on the informational role of
option markets. In Section II, we summarize the Hasbrouck (1995) method and
describe the modifications necessary to apply it to the options market. Our data
sources are described in Section III. Section IV presents our main results on
price discovery in the stock and ATM call options. In Section V, we extend the
analysis to OTM and ITM options, and seek to explain cross-sectional variation
in the relative information share measures of ATM and OTM options. In Section
VI, we report some additional robustness tests. Section VII summarizes our
results and contains suggestions for future research.

[[👶introduction notes]]

You should go with a so called “Feynman's method”.  
He described in one of his interviews, that he would read scientific papers in a following fashion:

- Read the abstract.
- Try to predict what are the results and conclusions of the paper.
- Go ahead to “Conclusions” section — check whether your prediction stands.
- If your prediction was successful don't bother reading the rest of the paper, go to the next one.
- If the outcome surprised you, then read the whole paper and carefully study the methods.
- Profit!
