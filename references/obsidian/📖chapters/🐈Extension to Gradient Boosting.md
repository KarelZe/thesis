- Introduce the notion of probilistic classifiers
- Possible extension could be [[@yarowskyUnsupervisedWordSense1995]]. See also Sklearn Self-Training Classifier.
- Discuss why probabilities of gradient boosted trees might be missleading [[@arikTabNetAttentiveInterpretable2020]]
- Problems of tree-based approaches and neural networks in semi-supervised learning. See [[@huangTabTransformerTabularData2020]] or [[@arikTabNetAttentiveInterpretable2020]]and [[@tanhaSemisupervisedSelftrainingDecision2017]]

- See [[@tanhaSemisupervisedSelftrainingDecision2017]] for discussion of self-training in conjunction with decision trees and random forests.
- pseudocode for self-supervised algorithm can be found in [[@tanhaSemisupervisedSelftrainingDecision2017]].![[pseudocode-selftraining.png]]
