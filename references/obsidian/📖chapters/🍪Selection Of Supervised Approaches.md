**Problem formulation:**
- What type of data do we deal with?
- What is tabular data? What do we mean by categorical and numerical?
- What is probabilistic classification? Why do we do probabilistic classification?

**Criteria formulation:**
- What criteria should the models fulfil?
	- Interpretable
	- SOTA performance
	- Extendable for learning on unlabelled data
	- Suitable for classification
- Why do these criteria make sense?
- Why is it hard to assess the performance for tabular data? Can we be sure about SOTA?

**Discussion:**
- Which models does the discussion consider?
- What models do we try out finally?
