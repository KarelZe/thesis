**Problem formulation:**
- What type of data do we deal with?
- What is tabular data? What do we mean by categorical and numerical?
- What is probabilistic classification? Why do we do probabilistic classification?

**Criteria formulation:**
- What criteria should the models fulfil?
	- Interpretable
	- SOTA performance
	- Extendable for learning on unlabelled data
	- Suitable for classification
- Why do these criteria make sense?
- Why is it hard to assess the performance for tabular data? Can we be sure about SOTA?

**Discussion:**
- Which models does the discussion consider?
- What models do we try out finally?



**Notes:**
[[üç™Selection of supervised approaches notes]]

Due to the tabular nature of the data, with features arranged in a row-column fashion, the token embedding (see chapter [[üõåToken Embedding]]) is replaced for a *column embedding*. Also the notation needs to be adapted to the tabular domain. We denote the data set with $D:=\left\{\left(\mathbf{x}_k, y_k\right) \right\}_{k=1,\cdots N}$ identified with $\left[N_{\mathrm{D}}\right]:=\left\{1, \ldots, N_{\mathrm{D}}\right\}$.  Each tuple $(\boldsymbol{x}, y)$ represents a row in the data set, and consist of the binary classification target $y \in \mathbb{R}$ and the vector of features $\boldsymbol{x} = \left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{cat}}, \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{cont}}\right\}$, where $x_{\text{cont}} \in \mathbb{R}^c$ denotes all $c$ numerical features and $\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{cat}}\in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ all $m$ categorical features. We denote the cardinality of the $j$-th feature with $j \in 1, \cdots m$ with $N_{C_j}$.
