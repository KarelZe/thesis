- look into [[@lonesHowAvoidMachine2022]]
- training of the transformer has been found non-trivial[[@liuUnderstandingDifficultyTraining2020]]
- Do less alchemy and more understanding [Ali Rahimi's talk at NIPS(NIPS 2017 Test-of-time award presentation) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi1Yry33TQE)
- Keep algorithms / ideas simple. Add complexity only where needed! 
- Don't chase the benchmark, but aim for explainability of the results.
- compare against https://github.com/jktis/Trade-Classification-Algorithms
- Classical rules could be implemented using https://github.com/jktis/Trade-Classification-Algorithms
