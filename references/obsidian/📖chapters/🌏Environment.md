In this Section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting and transformer-based approaches for trade classification. We benchmark against the LR algorithm, EMO algorithm, CLNV algorithm, as well as hybrids involving the trade size rule and depth rule on two datasets of option trades recorded at the ISE and CBOE.

Experiments were conducted on nodes of the *bwHPC cluster* running Ubuntu 20.04, with x processor x.xGHz, x GB RAM,  and 4 Nvidia Tesla V100. For reproducibility the implementation and experiment tracking is publicly available. -footnote(wandb + github)

The subsequent section provides further details on the dataset.
