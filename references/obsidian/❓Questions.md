- differnence `ROOT` / `UNDERLYING_SYMBOL`?
- Differences in accuracy for classical rules. Do you assign classes randomly for trades that can not be classified with the quote rule? What floating point precision was used? Did you use different features?
- Could I please get the current stock price for moneyness? Type of underlying e. g., index to integrate them in my robustness checks?
- Additional data e. g., sector of underlying instead of symbol. Symbol / root is somewhat problematic, as some are only in the train set or test set.
- Which offset was used?
- Access to computing resources requires signature of chair. See: https://www.scc.kit.edu/downloads/ISM/Accessform_bwUniCluster_DE_EN.pdf or  https://www.scc.kit.edu/downloads/ism/Accessform_courses_bwUniCluster_DE_EN.pdf

## Closed
- What are the expectations I have to meet in order to reach $\geq 1.3$?
- Any feedback to toc / expose / first results? -> *It's ok.*
- Opinions on weekly release info ðŸ“§ (e. g., every sunday) with closed issues and completed tasks + short bi-weekly meeting. -> *Meeting scheduled. Release notes sent.*
- Who would co-supervise / grade the thesis? What is his / her special focus e. g., economical inference/interpretability? -> *Prof. Dr. Uhrig-Homburg (1), Prof. Dr. Ruckes (2). Prof. Uhrig-Homburg is very open to new ideas.* 
- Discuss what to do with low-quality papers e. g., [[@ronenMachineLearningTrade2022]] or [[@blazejewskiLocalNonparametricModel2005]]? Cite, but be critical? Is it ok to also leave some poor papers out? -> *Ok, to leave out or point out what is problematic.*
- What to do with [[@hansenApplicationsMachineLearning]]? Thesis does something similar but was not published. Mostly different techniques / different data set / focus on EDA.
- Discuss citations of pre-prints? Some important concepts in ML have only been published on [archive.org](www.archive.org). -> *Citing preprints is ok.*
