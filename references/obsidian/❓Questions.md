- differnence `ROOT` / `UNDERLYING_SYMBOL`
- current stock price for moneyness? Type of underlying e. g., index?
- differences in accuracy for classical rules? Do you assign classes randomly for trades that can not be classified with the quote rule? What precision was used? Did you use different features?
- Additional data e. g., sector of underlying instead of symbol. Symbol / root is somewhat problematic as some are only in the train set or test set.
- Would the current baseline be good enough?



- Any feedback to toc / expose / first results?
- What are the expectations I have to meet in order to reach $\geq 1.3$?
- Opinions on weekly release info ðŸ“§ (e. g., every sunday) with closed issues and completed tasks + short bi-weekly meeting.
- Who would co-supervise / grade the thesis? What is his / her special focus e. g., economical inference/interpretability?
- Do you see any problem that trade classification with ML is chasing noise?
- Discuss what to do with low-quality papers e. g., [[@ronenMachineLearningTrade2022]] or [[@blazejewskiLocalNonparametricModel2005]]? Cite, but be critical? Is it ok to also leave some poor papers out?
- What to do with [[@hansenApplicationsMachineLearning]]? Thesis does something similar but was not published. Mostly different techniques / different data set / focus on EDA.
- Discuss citations of pre-prints? Some important concepts in ML have only been published on [archive.org](www.archive.org).
